Drill a No. 50 hole 1-1/4'' '' from one end and tap 2-56 . ( See Fig. 7 . ) Put a 2-56 roundhead screw into the hole , cut off the excess threads and file flush with the underside of the bar . To find the other stop screw position , insert the tappet into the frame and hold the screw head tight against the frame edge . Scribe a line across the bar on the other end of the tappet , 1/4'' '' plus half the diameter of the 2-56 screw head ( about 5/64'' '' ) away from the frame edge . Total distance is about 21/64'' '' . Tend to make this dimension slightly undersize so you can file the screw head to get exactly 1/4'' '' tappet movement . Drill a No. 50 hole , tap 2-56 and insert a roundhead 2-56 screw as you did on the first end . Drill a No. 47 hole crosswise through the tappet at the position shown in Figs. 7 and 8 . Repeat these drill and tap operations for each of the tappet bars . To each tappet except 6 and 8 , solder a Af piece of brass and file to the tapered shape shown in Figs. 6 and 8 . These will serve as lifting pads for the electrical contacts . Fitting the locking bars and making the locking pieces is a rather tedious job since stop screws , tappets and locking bars must be removed and replaced many times . As the work progresses the frame and moving parts become a sort of Chinese puzzle where several pieces must be removed before the part you are working on is accessible . A little extra work here will pay off with a smooth , snug-fitting machine when you are finished . Each completed locking bar should remain in place as the work progresses to insure snug fitting . The order of fitting is not too important . However , we started with the first row of bars and worked our way back . Since the same method of shaping and fitting the dogs and notches is used throughout , we will only describe the construction of one locking bar . Figs. 7 and 8 give all pertinent dimensions . All the bars are cut from Af brass . The lengths of each piece are listed at the bottom of Fig. 7 . Bar `` C '' is 2-3/4'' '' long . Draw-file the edges , square up the ends and put a slight chamfer on the edges so they will not snag in the frame . Fig. 8 gives the dimensions for locating the dog-pin holes . Center-punch and drill the No. 31 hole 7/16'' '' from one end of the bar . Chuck a length of 1/8'' '' dia. drill rod into a drill press or some similar turning device and while it is rotating file the end square and then file a slight taper 1/8'' '' long . Cut the piece about 9/32'' '' or 5/16'' '' long and drive it into the No. 31 hole drilled in the locking bar . File the bottom edge flush with the bar and the top 1/8'' '' above the bar . This dog will engage a notch to be cut in tappet 3 . Place the locking bar in proper position and insert tappet 3 . Scribe a line through the center of the pin and across the face of tappet 3 , parallel to piece `` A '' . See the drawings for the shape of the notch . Scribe V-shaped lines on the bar and rough out with either a hack saw or a cutting disk in a hand power tool . We used the latter equipped with a carborundum disk about '' thick and 1'' '' dia. fitted on a 1/8'' '' dia. mandrel . Such disks are very handy for cutting and shaping small parts . File to a smooth finish . A Barrette Swiss pattern file is handy since its triangular shape with only one cutting face will allow you to work a surface without marring an adjoining one . Endeavor to get the notches as much alike as possible . The notch should have a smooth finish so that the steel dog will slide easily over it . Assemble the parts in the frame and test the sliding action of the mating pieces . All matching surfaces should be checked frequently and mated on a cut and fit basis . Chuck a 2'' '' or 3'' '' piece of 1/8'' '' dia. drill rod in a drill press or electric hand tool . Fashion a sharp scribing point about 3/64'' '' long on one end , using Swiss pattern files . This tool can also be made with a lathe . Scientists say that the world and everything in it are based on mathematics . Without math the men who are continually seeking the causes of and the reasons for the many things that make the world go 'round would not have any means of analyzing , standardizing , and communicating the things they discover and learn . Math and the formulas that allow it to be applied to different problems are , therefore , essential to any scientific endeavor . Hot rodding is a science . It's not a science as involved as determining what makes the earth rotate on its axis or building a rocket or putting a satellite into orbit but it is , nevertheless , a science . But because science is based on mathematics doesn't mean that a hot rodder must necessarily be a mathematician . A guy can be an active and successful hot rodder for years without becoming even remotely involved with mathematical problems ; ; however , he will have a clearer understanding of what he is doing and the chances are he will be more successful if he understands the few formulas that apply to rodding . A mathematical formula is nothing more than a pattern for solving a specific problem . It places the various factors involved in the problem in their correct order in relation to each other so that the influence of factors on each other can be computed . The first step in using a formula is to insert the numerical values of the factors involved in their correct positions in the formula . This changes the formula to an `` equation '' . The equation is used for the mathematical process of solving the problem . Equations for rodding formulas are not complicated . They involve only simple mathematics that are taught in grammar school arithmetic classes . However , it is essential that the various mathematical symbols used in the equations be understood so that the mathematical processes can be done properly and in their correct order . They indicate simple division , multiplication , subtraction , and addition . The symbol for division is a straight line that separates two numbers placed one above the other . The lower number is always divided into the upper number : Af . The symbol for multiplication is `` **b '' . It is used to separate two or more numbers in a row . For example : Af . Numbers to be multiplied together may be multiplied in any order . The result will be the same regardless of the order used . The symbol for subtraction is the standard minus sign . This is nothing more than a dash . It separates two or more numbers . The number on the right of the symbol is always subtracted from the number on the left of the symbol . For example : Af . When more than two figures are separated by subtraction symbols the subtraction must be carried out from the left to right if the result is to be correct . For example , for the problem Af , 10 from 25 equals 15 , then 6 from 15 equals 9 . Addition is indicated by the + symbol . The symbol is used to separate two or more numbers . For example : Af . Numbers separated by addition symbols may be placed in any order . When solving an equation that involves division as well as other steps , do all the division steps first to reduce those parts of the equation to their numerical value . Multiplication , subtraction , and addition can then be accomplished as they appear in the equation by starting at the left end of the equation and working toward the right . Completing the division first also includes those division parts that require multiplication , subtraction , or addition steps : Af . This would be reduced by multiplying 8 times 6 and then dividing the product by 12 . This part of the equation would then become 4 . For use in formulas , fractions should be converted to their decimal equivalents . The easiest way to do this is with a conversion chart . Charts for this purpose are available from many sources . They are included in all types of mathematical handbooks and they are stamped on some types of precision measuring instruments . The various mathematical processes can be simplified by carrying the results to only two or three decimal places . Shortening the results in this manner will not have any detrimental effect on the accuracy of the final result . Some formulas contain `` constants '' . A constant is a number that remains the same regardless of the other numbers used in the formula and the resultant equation . It is a number without which the equation cannot be solved correctly . Rodding formulas apply to many phases of the sport . The answers they give can often pave the way to performance increases and , quite often , are necessary for completing entry blanks for different events . When it is needed , one formula is as important as another . However , some formulas are used more than others . We'll take them in the general order of their popularity . Engine displacement A rodder should be able to compute the displacement of his engine . Displacement is sometimes referred to as `` swept volume '' . Most entry blanks for competitive events require engine displacement information because of class restrictions . It is good to be able to compute displacement so that changes in it resulting from boring and stroking can be computed . Factors involved in the displacement formula are the bore diameter of the engine's cylinders , the length of the piston stroke , the number of cylinders in the engine , and a constant . The constant is , which is one-quarter of 3.1416 , another constant known as `` pi '' . Pi is used in formulas concerned with the dimensions of circles . Actually , the engine displacement formula is the standard formula for computing the volume of a cylinder of any type with an added factor that represents the number of cylinders in the engine . The cross-sectional area of the cylinders is determined and then the volume of the individual cylinders is computed by multiplying the area by the stroke length , which is the equivalent of the length of the cylinders . Multiplying the result by the number of cylinders in the engine gives the engine's total displacement . The formula is : Af . Dimensions in inches , and fractions of inches will give the displacement in cubic inches . Dimensions in centimeters and fractions of centimeters will give the displacement in cubic centimeters ( cc. ) . One inch equals 2.54 centimeters : one cubic inch equals 16.38 cubic centimeters . For example , let's consider a standard 283 cubic inch Chevy Aj . These engines have a cylinder diameter of 3-7/8 inches and a stroke length of 3 inches . The formula , with the fractions converted to decimals , becomes Af . To arrive at the answer , multiply the numbers together by starting at the left of the group and working to the right . The different steps will look like this : Af . Compression ratio A cylinder's compression ratio is computed by comparing the cylinder's volume , or its displacement , with the total volume of the cylinder and its combustion chamber . Cylinder volume can be determined mathematically but combustion chamber volume must be measured with a liquid . Cylinder volume is determined in exactly the same manner as for the displacement formula : Af . To measure the volume of one of the combustion chambers in the cylinder head , install the valves and spark plug in the chamber and support the head so that its gasket surface is level . Then pour water or light oil from a graduated beaker into the chamber to fill the chamber to its gasket surface . Do not overfill the chamber . This is possible with water and other liquids that have a high surface tension . Such liquids will rise to a considerable height above the surface around the chamber before they will flow out of the chamber . The amount of liquid poured into the chamber is determined by subtracting the quantity still in the beaker when the chamber is full from the original quantity . Most beakers are graduated in cubic centimeters ( cc. ) , making it necessary to convert the result to cubic inches . However , the displacement of the cylinder can be converted to cubic centimeters . The compression ratio arrived at with the formula will be the same regardless of whether cubic inches or cubic centimeters are used . The only precaution is that all volumes used in the formula be quoted in the same terms . The volume of the cylinder opening in the head gasket must be computed by multiplying its area in square inches by the gasket's thickness in thousandths of an inch . Sometimes it is necessary to roughly calculate the square inch area of the opening but the calculation can usually be made with sufficient accuracy that it won't affect the final computation . The volume of the opening is added to the combustion chamber volume . Another thing that must be taken into consideration is the volume of the area between the top of the piston and the top of the cylinder block when the piston is in top dead center position . Compute this volume by measuring the distance from the top of the block to the piston head as accurately as possible with a depth micrometer or some other precision measuring device and then multiply the area of the cylinder by the depth . The formula for this step is : Af . This volume is added to the total volume of the combustion chamber and head gasket opening . The total of these three volumes is the `` final combustion chamber volume '' . After the factors just described have been computed , they are applied to the following formula : Af . For an example let's dream up an engine that has a final combustion chamber volume of 5 cubic inches and a cylinder volume of 45 cubic inches . Applying these figures to the formula we get the equation : Af . The compression ratio is 10 to 1 . This method of computing compression ratio cannot be used accurately for engines that have pistons with either domed or irregularly shaped heads . Any irregularity on the piston heads will make it impossible , with normal means , to determine the final combustion chamber volume because the volume displaced by the piston heads cannot be readily computed . The only way to determine the final combustion chamber volume when such pistons are used is by measuring it with liquid while the cylinder head is bolted to the cylinder block and the piston is in top dead center position . Gear ratio -- speed relationships There are four versions of the formula that involves the relationships of car speed , engine speed , rear axle gear ratio , and rear tire size . By using the appropriate version any one of these factors can be determined for any combination of the other three . To simplify the formulas a representative symbol is substituted for each of the factors . These are MPH for Car speed , for Engine crankshaft speed , for Rear axle gear ratio , for Tire size . Tire size can be determined in several ways but the one that is the easiest and as accurate as any is by measuring the effective radius of a wheel and tire assembly . This is done by measuring the distance from the surface on which the tire is resting to the center of the rear axle shaft . A tire must be inflated to its normal hot operating pressure and the car must be loaded to its operating weight when this measurement is made . The measurement must be in inches . Any fraction of an inch involved in the measurement must be converted to a decimal equivalent to simplify the mathematics . When tire size is measured in this manner a constant of 168 is used in the formula . To determine car speed for a given combination of engine speed , gear ratio , and tire size , the formula is : Af . For an engine speed of 5000 rpm , a gear ratio of 4.00 to 1 , and a tire radius of 13 inches , the equation would look like this : Af . To determine engine speed for a given combination of the other three factors the formula is : Af . Using the same figures as for the previous example , the equation becomes : Af . To determine the rear axle gear ratio for a combination of the other three factors , the formula is : Af . Using the figures from the previous examples , the equation becomes : Af . Orlando , Fla. , Feb. 2 -- The best 2-year-old pacing mile up to date at Ben White Raceway has been that of Mary Liner ( Mainliner-Highland Ellen ) , a member of the Dick Williams stable , who was clocked 2:25 . She is owned by Ralph H. Kroening , Milwaukee , Wis. , who , according to the railbirds , can feel justly proud of her . Other good miles have been by Debonnie ( Dale Frost-Debby Hanover ) and Prompt Time ( Adios-On Time ) in 2:28-:36 ; ; Kimberly Gal ( Galophone-Kimberly Hanover ) 2:26.2 ; ; Laguerre Hanover ( Tar Heel-Lotus Hanover ) and Monel ( Tar Heel-Miracle Byrd ) in 2:34 . Laguerre Hanover is outstanding in type and conformation -- good body , plenty of heart girth , stands straight on his legs on excellent feet -- and has the smoothest gait . This colt is behind most of the other 2-year-olds in the Simpson stable but can show about as much pace as any of them . Monel shows improvement with each work-out and looks the makings of a good brood mare after winning her share of races . Stardel ( Star's Pride-Starlette Hanover ) , 2:34 , looks quite promising . Fury Hanover ( Hoot Mon-Fay ) , Caper ( Hoot Mon-Columbia Hanover ) and Isaac ( Hoot Mon-Goddess Hanover ) has been working together but have not equalled their best work done some weeks ago . Fury and Caper worked in 2:35 and did it with ease . They are two good colts of different type . Fury is upstanding and on the rangy side , and Caper is more the compact type . I have never seen Caper off his feet -- he seems to know nothing but ' trot ' and keeps trying a little harder if asked to do so . Fury has made a few mistakes but looks like a wonderful prospect , with his impressive gait and stride which certainly make him cover the ground . Trackdown ( Torrid-Mighty Lady ) has worked a mile in 2:33.3 . It took this colt several weeks to strike a pace . Then , after emasculation , he was eased up for a couple of weeks . He has thrived on all he has gone through and looks the makings of a good little race horse . Thor Hanover ( Adios-Trustful Hanover ) is a wonderful looking prospect and another good individual , with solid , rugged conformation , good , flat bone and excellent feet . This colt arrived at the Raceway early last November , and immediately was put into harness and line-driven for a few days , and then put to cart and broken in very nicely , knowing nothing but trot . He appeared in the hopples about November 14 , was treated for worms on the 18th , the latter date being the first time he struck a real pace . On December 5 he paced a mile in 55 on the twice-around , out in third position all the way . This colt has done everything asked of him , and done it with ease . His best mile to date is 2:32.2 . Gamecock ( Tar Heel-Terka Hanover ) is another promising colt , and his best time is 2:32.2 . This is one of the best-tempered Tar Heels ever at the center . The first time he was harnessed he stood like a gentle old mare ; ; the crupper under his tail seemed to be old stuff . The fourth time in harness he walked off like a gentleman . Being blistered for curbs has delayed his work somewhat . But up to date he has shown as much as any in the big Simpson stable . Hustler ( Knight Dream-Torkin ) is a playful bay rascal of a colt , not the best gaited , but he surely can pace and is right there with them , and sometimes leading them , in the best miles . Torrid Freight ( Torrid-Breeze On Hal ) is a very rugged , strong-made colt with a wonderful stride who has done with ease everything asked of him . His best time is around 2:33 . Strongheart ( Adios-Direct Gal ) , a fair-looking sorrel colt , knows nothing but pace and has been right there in the best miles . Torrid Adios ( Torrid-Adios Molly ) is not so masculine as most of the colts , but I like his type and he certainly is one of the best-gaited pacers on the grounds . Blistered for curbs and laid off three weeks , he is coming along fine and looks like a pacer to me . First Flyer ( Frisco Flyer-Castle Light ) looks like a splendid candidate for the Illinois Stakes . His best time is 2:33.2 . The colts in Simpson's stable have little if anything on the fillies , especially the pacers . Justine Hanover ( Sampson Hanover-Justitia Hanover ) is improving with each work-out and paced 2:32.4 weeks ago . Mrs. Freight ( Knight Dream-Miss Reed ) shows promise and does it in good form , and her best time is about 2:35 . Hoopla ( Tar Heel-Holiday Hanover ) , a filly that wanted to trot , knocked herself October 31 and November 1 fighting the hopples . She was then trained on the trot until December 29 , hitched to a breaking cart once around the half-mile track and hoppled again . This time she submitted and in a few days was going good . On January 11 she paced a mile in 2:43.1--:38 ; ; on Jan. 18 2:37.3--:36.1 ; ; on Jan. 21 , , 2:36 . This filly is a much better individual than either of her full-sisters , Valentine Day and Cerise -- more scale and much better underpinning . She is more like her full brother , Taraday Hanover , but larger . Up to date she is a grand-looking filly . Pete Dailey has four promising 2-year-old pacers . Marquis Pick ( Gene Abbe-Direct Grattan ) seems to be the pick of the stable at the present time . He is a fine-looking colt with a good body , good set of legs and nice way of going . His best mile to date is 2:28-:33 . Majestic Pick comes next , with a mile in 2:30-:33.2 . This colt is another fine-looking equine . Staley Hanover ( Knight Dream-Sweetmite Hanover ) is a little on the small side but a very compact colt and looks like one to stand training and many future battles with colts in his class . Best time to date is 2:34-:34 . Step Aside ( Direct Rhythm-Wily Widow ) has worked in 2:32 on the half-mile track and shows promise . Most of Billy Haughton's 2-year-olds have worked from 2:40 to 2:35 . Bonnie Wick ( Gene Abbe-Scotch Mary ) has gone in 2:36 ; ; Hickory Ash ( Titan Hanover-Misty Hanover ) in 2:35 . The first time I saw the latter filly she trotted by me and I noticed such a family resemblance that I said to myself , `` that must be Hickory Ash '' . She is a beautiful filly and likes to trot . Hickory Hill ( Star's Pride-Venus Hanover ) has gone in 2:33 ; ; Hickory Spark ( Harlan-Hickory Tiny ) 2:37 ; ; Buxton Hanover ( Tar Heel-Beryl Hanover ) 2:35 ; ; Faber's Kathy ( Faber Hanover-Ceyway ) 2:37 ; ; Honor Rodney ( Rodney-Honor Bright ) around 2:40 . The last-named is a fine-looking , large colt , who has been unfortunate to be laid off for some time due to injuries . He is going sound again now , and looks good . Brief Candle ( Harlan-Marcia ) has gone in 2:37 ; ; Lena Faber ( Faber Hanover-Chalidale Lena ) 2:33 ; ; Martha Rodney ( Rodney-Miss Martha D. ) 2:35 ; ; Checkit ( Faber Hanover-Supermarket ) 2:35 ; ; Charm Rodney ( Rodney-The Charmer ) 2:37 ; ; Fair Sail ( Farvel-Topsy Herring ) 2:36 ; ; Custom Maid ( Knight Dream-Way Dream ) 2:34.2 ; ; Jacky Dares ( ( Meadow Gene-Princess Lorraine ) 2:36 ; ; Good Flying ( Good Time-Olivette Hanover ) 2:36 ; ; Bordner Hanover ( Tar Heel-Betty Mahone ) 2:34 ; ; Faber's Choice ( Faber Hanover-Sally Joe Whippet ) 2:36 ; ; Invercalt ( Florican-Inverness ) 2:35 ; ; Duffy Dares ( Meadow Gene-Princess Mite ) 2:36 ; ; Harold J. ( Worthy Boy-Lady Scotland ) 2:36 ; ; Knightfall ( Knight Dream-Miss Worthy Grapes ) 2:36 ; ; Next Knight ( Knight Dream-Next Time ) 2:36 ; ; Trader Jet ( Florican-My Precious ) 2:37 ; ; Trader Rich ( Worthy Boy-Marquita Hanover ) 2:37 ; ; Good Little Girl ( Good Time-Mynah Hanover ) 2:36 ; ; Iosola Hanover ( Kimberly Kid-Isoletta Hanover ) 2:36 . The last-named is one of the favorites in the stable , and the boys like her very much . I will be able to tell you more about this string of equines in the near future . I have just seen Debonnie and Prompt Time work a mile in 2:34 , last quarter in :35.3 . In going away Debonnie got behind several lengths , stalling at the start -- she is a little fussy . They left the three-quarters together and finished almost together . Prompt Time shows class . This filly is another Adios that wants to trot , and trot she did until forced to do otherwise . After well broken and equipped with 12-oz. shoes on behind , bare-footed in front , she would trot a real storm with the master , Delvin , driving . Being placed in the hopples she was completely baffled . She hesitated , she hopped , she rolled and rocked , skipped and jumped , but in some two weeks she started to pace , From that time to this she has shown steady improvement and now looks like one of the classiest things on the grounds . Rain on Friday prevented many workouts , but there were a few miles of note on Thursday . Those responsible included Stardel Hanover ( Star's Pride-Starlette Hanover ) , 2:30-:34.3 ; ; Lorena Gallon ( Bill Gallon-Loren Hanover ) , 2:30-:34.3 ; ; Prudent Hanover ( Dean Hanover-Precious Hanover ) , 2:30.3-:35.3 ; ; Premium Freight ( Titan Hanover-Pebble Hanover ) , 2:30.3-35.3 ; ; Laguerre Hanover ( ( Tar Heel-Lotus Hanover ) , 2:30.3-:36.1 ; ; Monel ( Tar Heel-Miracle Byrd ) , 2:30.3-:36.1 ; ; Fury Hanover ( Hoot Mon-Fay ) , 2:30.3-:36 ; ; Isaac ( Hoot Mon-Goddess Hanover ) , 2:30.3-:36 ; ; Caper ( Hoot Mon-Columbia Hanover ) , 2:30.3-:36 ; ; Lucky Freight ( Knight Dream-Lusty Helen ) , 2:31.3-:35.3 . Sam Caton's Butterwyn ( Scotch Victor-Butler Wyn ) , a light bay filly , knows nothing but trot and has worked on the half-mile in 2:30-:36 . Riverboat ( Dalzell-Cousin Rachel ) has gone in 2:38 . Sam is having his troubles with Layton Hanover ( Dean Hanover-Lucy Hanover ) , but hopes to have him straightened out and going before long . Jimmy Jordon is high on Adios Scarlet ( Adios-Rena Grattan ) and she sure looks good as she goes by . Her best time to date is about 2:30 . He also likes Hampton Hanover ( Titan Hanover-Bertie Hanover ) 2:37 . Cathy J. Hanover ( Tar Heel-Kaola Hanover ) , formerly called Karet Hanover , has been rather a problem child , but is getting better all the while and can pace a twice around in about 2:31 . Armbro Comet ( Nibble Hanover-Mauri Hanover ) has been in 2:38 . Flick Nipe's and Neil Engle's Miss Phone ( Galophone-Prissy Miss ) is a fine-looking filly with good disposition and good gait , and she has worked up to date in 2:46 . Del Mar , Calif. , Feb. 3 -- After 52 rainless days , moisture finally came to Del Mar , resulting in but one workout during the week for most of the horses , and leaving us with less than half our total average rainfall during the season . While 2-year-olds are still gaining most of the attention at the track , green horses are starting to go a bit , and Jimmy Cruise has several that can really make it . Work-outs for the week are as follows : Plain Scotch , 3 ( by Scotch Victor ) , Demon Law , 3 ( by Demon Hanover ) , Coffee Royal , p ( by Royal Blackstone ) and Beauty Way , p , 3 ( by Demon Hanover ) in 25 ; ; Eddie Duke , p , 3 ( by Duke Of Lullwater ) , Marilyn C. , p ( by Sampson Hanover ) and Chalidale Barry , 5 ( by King's Ransom ) in 2:20 ; ; Tiger Hanover , p , 3 ( by Adios ) in 2:26 ; ; Sherwood Lass , 4 ( by Victory Song ) in 2:22 ; ; and Dauntless , 3 ( by Greentree Adios ) in 2:32 . For the aged horses : Mr. Budlong , p , 2:00.2 , Lottie Thomas , p , 2:04.2 , Mighty Signal 2:03 , Clever Braden , p , 2:01.1 , and Glow Star , p , 2:02.3 have been in 2:35 ; ; Miss Demon Abbe , p , 1:59.3 has trotted in 2:26 , and is expected to race at this gait ; ; Carter Creed , p , 3 , 2:01.1 , Great Lullwater 2:00.3 , and Hi Jay , p , 2:05.1 have been in 2:30 ; ; Tanker T. , 3 , 2:05.3 is now wearing hopples and has trained in 2:19 ; ; Stormy Dream , p , 2:01.3 , Demon Abbe , p , 2:02 , Dundeen B. , 4 , 2:04.2 , Claudia's Song , 3 , 2:06.3 , and ( Jet Fire , 4 , 2:02.2 have been in 2:25 ; ; Maria Key , 2 , 2:06 looked great in 2:22 ; ; Mocking Byrd , p , 2:01.1 has been in 2:12 , with a racing date approaching at Bay Meadows . Dewey Urban has a clever green trotter in Dr. Orin I. , 3 ( by Yankee Hanover ) , his latest mile in 2:20 ; ; Victory Sun , p , 2:04 has trained in 2:24 ; ; Early Sun , p , 2:02.3 , Chester Maid 2:05 , Dark Sun , p , 2:06.1 , and Sun Tan Maid 2:05.2 have been in 2:21 . The average reader of this magazine owns more than one gun ( we ran a survey to find out ) but he's always on the lookout for new and better arms . He's more than a reader of outdoor articles ; ; he's a real hunter and shooter , eager to improve his sport . Well , if you're that kind of sportsman we're here to help you . You've probably given a lot of Christmas-season thought to the guns in your rack , but it's not easy to decide on a new one . You still have time to drop a few hints about the gifts you'd appreciate most ; ; the time to decide on them is now . As a Christmas service , I've taken a close look at this year's crop of new models . Here they are , with my comments and judgments . Read on , take your pick -- and start dropping those hints . First on my own list would be two arms -- a rifle and a handgun -- that qualify as new in the strictest sense . For me , a changed barrel length or an improved stock doesn't constitute a truly new design . Such modifications are all for the best but it takes something as different as a Deerstalker or a Jet to change arms-making concepts . Bill Ruger's long-awaited Deerstalker ( under $110 ) is a new rifle action in a caliber that upsets all the modern theory of high-velocity fans ; ; it's a short , light , quick-handling , fast-firing little timber gun designed to push a heavy slug at modest velocity but with lots of killing power and ample range for our most popular big game -- whitetail . Ruger reports that on his recent African safari the little Magnum cartridge was a real work horse . Small antelope were generally grassed with one shot , and the Magnum carbine also bagged reedbuck , kob and wart hog with deadly efficiency ; ; these are fairly large , tough animals . The deadliness of the Magnum in a rifle comes as no surprise to me . At least five years ago , Tom Robinson of Marlin made up an over/under double rifle for me in this caliber , using the now defunct Model 90 action in 20-gauge size . After figuring out how to regulate the barrels so that they shot to the same point of impact , we fired this little 20-inch-barrel job on my home range and in Marlin's underground test gallery . We quickly ran into the same trouble that plagued Bill Ruger in his first experiments : Three or four bullets would be placed well in a six-inch bull at 100 yards and then , unaccountably , one could stray far out of the group . Ruger learned that this was because the higher velocity achieved in a long barrel was upsetting the shape of the unjacketed revolver bullet . The new , jacketed slug in Magnum corrected this . But even without jacketed bullets , I had enough faith in my double to take it on an opening-day deer hunt that first year . Within half an hour I jumped a six-point buck that hop-skipped through a rhododendron thicket , and I caught him just behind the left foreleg at 60 yards . He moved only about 30 feet after the 240-grain slug hit him -- and this was after the bullet had passed through a sapling . Three more deer have fallen to this same gun , and all were one-shot kills . My double was made with standard-weight revolver barrels ( before cutting to revolver length ) , and although it compares well in other respects , it's considerably heavier than the Deerstalker , which only scales about 6-1/2 pounds . If ever a rifle met the needs of the whitetail hunter , this is it . The Deerstalker points with the ease , speed and precision of a fine imported double shotgun , and its trigger pull is light and sharp . The 240-grain bullet leaves the muzzle at 1,850 fps , which gives it all the smash needed at woods ranges . With five shots at the immediate command of the hunter's trigger finger , the gun and load are a deadly combination . The second really new development this year was a revolver handling a different sort of varmint load -- the Remington Jet Magnum Center Fire . At present it's available in one model , the fine and familiar Smith & Wesson Magnum revolver ( about $110 ) , long a top-quality handgun among target arms . The velocity of this , 40-grain bullet is rated at a very hot 2,460 fps , and it's the flattest shooting of any revolver cartridge , with a mid-range rise of about an inch over a 100-yard range . This is a varmint load , pure and simple ; ; it's much too explosive for small edible game . It can cut a red squirrel neatly in two or burst a crow into a flurry of feathers . The most intriguing aspect of the S & W Magnum chambered for the new Jet is that it can also fire standard rim-fires by means of adapter sleeves in the chambers . You may therefore convert the gun into a small-game and plinking arm , although the difference in the point of impact ( Jet vs. rim-fire ) can be somewhat disconcerting . The accuracy of the Jet cartridge is fine ; ; I tested it in my scoped S & W and it was good enough to allow me to hit a chuck with every shot at 100 yards if I did my part by holding the handgun steadily . Hunting rifles , '61 The fact that the Deerstalker and the Jet were the only completely new designs this year doesn't mean that 1961 didn't see changes in models , actions and calibers . Aside from the Ruger carbine , a number of hunting rifles have been introduced for the first time . Here are the brands ( in alphabetical order ) and the new models . Newcomers to the American hunter are the Browning group of bolt-action , high-power rifles . They have fine FN actions and a better-than-average finish on both the metal and the stock wood . Barrel weights vary sensibly with the various calibers available , and these include the standard bores ( about $165 ) plus the Magnums ( around $170 ) ; ; the latter include the , S & H , , and . Shotgun-type rubber recoil pads are standard on all of the Magnums except the . Stock designs are excellent for use with scopes . Colt's center-fire 1961 rifles are all made with Sako actions , regardless of caliber . The have the short action ; ; the and , the medium action , and the , Af and the Magnums , the long action ( about $135 for the Standard Coltsman and $200 for the Custom version ) . Previously , FN actions were used for the larger cartridges . High Standard has introduced a auto , the Sport-King , in two grades -- field and special ( less than $45 and just over $45 , respectively ) . It's a streamlined rifle , fast and well-made . Among Magnum Rim-Fire rifles , 1961's lone newcomer was the Kodiak Model 260 autoloader ( around $60 ) . Previously known as Jefferson Arms , Kodiak has given this 11-shot hammerless job an exceptionally fine stock design , and the 260 is the first autoloader to handle Magnum rim-fires . Marlin has made two contributions to the harvest of new offerings . The Model 99 ( under $45 ) is a light-weight , streamlined rim-fire auto with a tubular magazine that holds 18 Long Rifles . It's extremely accurate for an auto , and the test rifle I tried was completely trouble-free in functioning . The 989 ( about $40 ) is an even newer auto , this one with a seven- or 12-shot clip . Once again the Mossberg Targo outfit has appeared , but this time as a bolt-action rifle-shotgun combination . The bore is unrifled but is provided with an insert tube which is rifled and which , surprisingly , gives pretty fair accuracy even though it's only 3-1/2 inches long . You can unscrew this tube and replace it with a smoothbore insert for use with shotshells -- to break the little Targo clay targets . A trap for throwing these miniature clays fastens to the barrel so that the shooter can throw his own targets . A spring trap for solid mounting and a regular hand trap are also available . You can have your choice of a seven-shot repeater , the 340TR ( about $40 ) or a single-shot , the 320TR ( $10 less ) . The Targo is a good outfit for fun shooting or for economic wing-shooting practice , but it's tougher than it looks to run up a score on the clay birds . They'll travel 50 feet or more when thrown from the spring trap but it's almost impossible to break one after it passes the 35-foot mark . The combination of thin pattern and very tiny pellets makes it necessary to get on the birds , right now ! Big Magnum calibers appeared in the Remington line for 1961 , with the addition of the and to the list of Model 725's . These are made on special order only , in Kodiak grade ( about $310 ) , with integral muzzle brakes and heavy rubber recoil pads ; ; they weigh around nine pounds . A shortened version of the highly regarded Remington 742 autoloader also appeared in 1961 . This carbine ( under $140 , about $15 more for a deluxe grade ) has an 18-1/2-inch barrel and was obviously inspired by the popularity of last year's Model 760 pump with a short-barrel . This design is hard to beat for timber hunting or for packing in a saddle scabbard . Presently , the 742C is available in Af . The latest versions of the famous Savage Model 99 are the 99 Featherweight ( about $125 ) and the 99 Deluxe ( under $135 ) , which have a top-tang safety and improved trigger design . The replacement of the slide-lock side safety catch will make this lever-action favorite more appealing than ever since the new safety is easier and faster to operate . Beginners' guns , '61 A fresh crop of beginners' guns showed up in 1961 , and they're good bets for your Christmas gift list if you're wondering what to get for a youngster . The most unusual of them is the Ithaca 49 ( about $20 , $5 for a saddle scabbard ) -- a lever-action single-shot patterned after the famous Winchester lever-action and featuring the Western look . Because of its traditional lines , it probably has more kid appeal than any other model . The action is a drop-block , handling all the standard rim-fires . Marlin's latest is also designed for the beginning shooter , although it's a full-sized rifle with plenty of barrel weight and ample stock . This is the Model 122 ( about $20 ) ; ; it's a single-shot bolt-action with an automatic safety -- i.e. , the safety goes on every time the bolt is lifted and the gun cocked for the next shot . Stock design is excellent , and this model is a good first gun . Another boy's model is the single-shot Remington 514C ( around $20 ) , which comes with a 21-inch barrel and a short -- 12-1/2-inch -- stock ; ; it's just right for a boy of 12-1/2 . A beginner's shotgun has also been introduced this year . The single-barrel Stevens 940Y ( under $35 ) is made with a side lever rather than a top-tang lever because many youngsters aren't strong enough to operate a top tang to open a gun -- and the side lever does indeed open very easily . This gun has a 12-1/2-inch stock and is available in either 20 or gauge . There's another addition to the Stevens line , the pump-action Model 77 in ( under $75 ) , which you may or may not consider a kid's gun ; ; many experienced hunters like this gauge and type of scattergun too . Shotguns , '61 Although there were no startling developments in shotgun design this year , a number of new models and variations of existing models did hit the market . For example , a Browning trap version of the Superposed over/under , the Broadway ( from $350 up , depending on grade ) , differs from standard models in that it is equipped with a full beavertail fore end , a cushion recoil pad and a barrel-wide ventilated rib for fast sighting . The Colt line now includes a new scattergun , the Standard or Custom Pump Model ( about $90 and $150 , respectively ) in 12 , 16 and 20 . Firearms International has introduced another import , this one from Finland . It's the Valmet ( about $170 ) , a 12-gauge over/under very much like the old Remington 32 -- which was so fine a gun that today a used one still brings high prices . High Standard has also added two models to its line . The Supermatic Trophy ( prices begin at less than $135 and depend on grade and optional features ) is a 12-gauge auto . The Flite-King Trophy ( beginning at just over $85 ) is a pump gun in 12 or 16 . Either model is a very good dollar value . Mossberg's latest contribution to the field is the Model 500 ( from $73.50 ) ; ; this is an improved version of the old Model 200 , a pump-action 12-gauge shotgun . See page 24 for a complete report on it . Handguns , '61 Aside from the Jet -- which I coupled with the Deerstalker carbine as one of the year's two biggest developments -- few significant innovations appeared among 1961's handguns . Livery stable -- J. Vernon , prop. '' . Coaching had declined considerably by 1905 , but the sign was still there , near the old Wells Fargo building in San Francisco , creaking in the fog as it had for thirty years . John Vernon had had all the patronage he cared for -- he had prospered , but he could not retire from horsedom . Coaching was in his blood . He had two interests in life : the pleasures of the table and driving . Twice a week he drove his tallyho over the Santa Cruz road , upland and through the redwood forest , with orchards below him at one hand , and glimpses of the Pacific at the other . The journey back he made along the coast road , traveling hell-for-leather , every lantern of the tallyho ablaze . The southward route was the classic run in California , and the most fashionable . His patronage on this stretch was made up largely of San Franciscans -- regulars , most of them , and trenchermen like himself . They did not complain at the inhuman hour of starting ( seven in the morning ) , nor of the tariff , which was reasonable since it covered everything but the tobacco . Breakfast was at the Palace Hotel , luncheon was somewhere in the mountain forest , and dinner was either at Boulder Creek or at Santa Cruz . Gazing too long at the scenery could be tiring , so halts were contrived between meals . Then the Chinese hostler , who rode with Vernon on the box , would break open a hamper and produce filets of smoked bass or sturgeon , sandwiches , pickled eggs , and a rum sangaree to be heated over a spirit lamp . In spring and in autumn the run was made for a group of botanists which included an old friend of mine . They gathered roots , bulbs , odd ferns , leaves , and bits of resin from the rare Santa Lucia fir , which exists only on a forty-five mile strip on the westerly side of these mountains . In the Spanish days Franciscan monks roamed here to collect the resin for incense . It yields a fragrance as Orphic as that of the pastilles of Malabar . Vernon was serviceable on the botanical field trips , but he could arrange no schedule with the cooks , and he was glad when the trips dropped off , and the botanists began to motor out by themselves . My friend often breakfasted with Vernon on the morning of the regular tallyho run . This was an honor , like dining with a captain at his private table . Vernon's office adjoined the stable , and the walls were adorned with brightly colored lithographs , the folk art of the period . They advertised harness polish , liniments , Ball's Rubber Boots , Green River Whiskey , Hood's Sarsaparilla , patent medicines , shoe blacking , and chewing tobacco . The hostler would have the table ready and a pot of coffee hissing on the stove ; ; then a porter from Manning's Fish House would trot in with a tray on his head . It was draped with snowy napkins that kept hot a platter of oyster salt roast and a mound of corn fritters . Vernon was consummately fond of oysters , and Manning's had been famous for them since the Civil War . Oyster salt roast -- oysters on the half shell , cooked on a bed of coarse salt that kept them hot when served -- was a standby at Manning's . Its early morning patrons were coachmen , who fortified themselves for the day with that delicacy . In the 1890's the Palace Hotel began serving an oyster dish named after its manager , John C. Kirkpatrick . This dish much resembles the oysters Rockefeller made famous by Antoine's in New Orleans , though the Palace chef announced it as a variant of Manning's roast oysters . ( Gastronomes have long argued about which came first , the Palace's or Antoine's . Antoine's held as mandatory a splash of absinthe or Pernod on the parsley or spinach which was used for the underbedding . The Kirkpatrick version holds liqueur as optional . ) Vernon , however , held out for plain oyster roast , and plenty of it , unadorned by herbs or any seasoning but salt , though he did fancy a bit of lemon . After the meal , he and his guests went out to inspect the rig ; ; this was merely a ritual , to please all hands concerned . The tallyho had cost Vernon $2,300 . A replica of two coaches made in England for the Belmont Club in the East , and matchless west of the Rockies , it was the despair of whips on the Santa Cruz run . One could shave in the reflection of its French-polished panels , and its axles were greased like those of roulette wheels . The horses were groomed to a high gloss ; ; departing , they stepped solemnly with knees lifted to the jaw , for they had been trained to drag at important funerals . But for the start of the Santa Cruz run , the whip fell . The clients boarded the tallyho at the Palace promptly at seven . They had been fed a hunting breakfast , so called because a kedgeree , the dish identified with fox hunting , was on the bill . There are many ways of making a kedgeree , every one of which is right . Here is an original kedgeree recipe from the Family Club's kitchen : Club Kedgeree Flake ( for three ) a cupful of cold boiled haddock , mix with a cupful of cooked rice , two minced hard-boiled eggs , some buttery white sauce done with cream , cayenne , pepper , salt , a pinch of curry , a tablespoonful of minced onion fried , and a bit of anchovy . Heat and serve hot on toast . The omelet named for Ernest Arbogast , the Palace's chef , was even more in demand . For decades it was the most popular dish served in the Ladies' Grill at breakfast , and it is one of the few old Palace dishes that still survive . Native California oysters , salty and piquant , as coppery as Delawares and not much larger than a five-cent piece , went into it . The original formula goes thus : omelet Arbogast Fry in butter a small minced onion , rub with a tablespoonful of flour , add half a cup of cream , six beaten eggs , pepper , celery salt , a teaspoonful of minced chives , a dash of cayenne , and a pinch of nutmeg . A jigger of dry Sherry follows , and as the mixture stiffens , in go a hundred of the little oysters . Louis Sherry once stayed a fortnight at the Palace , and he was so pleased with omelet Arbogast that he introduced it at his restaurant in New York J. Pierpont Morgan had come in his private train to San Francisco , to attend an Episcopal convention , and brought the restaurateur with him . As things happened , Morgan was installed in the Nob Hill residence of a magnate friend , whose kitchen swarmed with cooks of approved talent . Sherry remained in his hotel suite , where he amused himself as best he could . Twice he left everything to his entourage , and fled to make the Santa Cruz tour under Vernon's guidance . In the grand court of the Palace , notable for its tiers of Moorish galleries that looked down on the maelstrom of vehicles below , Vernon's station was at the entrance . It was a post of honor , held inviolate for him ; ; he had the primacy among the coachmen . Of majestic build , rubicund and slash-mouthed , he resembled the late General Winfield Scott , who was said to be the most imposing general of his century , if not of all centuries . Vernon wore a gray tall hat , a gardenia , and maroon Wellington boots that glistened like currant jelly . Promptly at seven he would clatter out of the court with twelve in the tallyho . He had style : he held his reins in a loose bunch at the third button of his checked Epsom surtout , and when the horses leaned at a curve , as if bent by the force of a gale , he leaned with them . They cantered down the peninsula , not slackening until the coach reached Woodside where the Santa Cruz uplands begin . The road maps of the region have changed since 1905 ; ; inns have burned down , moved elsewhere , or taken other names . Once on the road ( and especially if the passengers were all regulars and masculine ) , the schedule meant nothing . An agreeable ease suffused Vernon and the passengers of the tallyho , from which there issued clouds of smoke . Vernon would tilt his hat over one ear as he lounged with his feet on the dashboard , indulging in a huge cigar . The horses moved at a clump ; ; they were no more on parade than was their driver ; ; one fork of the road was as good as another . The Santa Cruz mountains sprawl over three counties , and the roads twist through sky-tapping redwoods down whose furrowed columns ripple streams of rain , even when heat bakes the Santa Clara valley below at the left . The water splashes into shoulder-high tracts of fernery . You arrive there in seersucker , and feel you were half-witted not to bring a mackintosh . Vernon kept an account book with a list of all the establishments that he thought worthy of patronage . A number of them must have fallen into disfavor ; ; they were struck out with remarks in red ink , denouncing both the cooks and the management . He was copious in his praise of those that served food that was good to eat . The horses seemed to know these by instinct , he used to say : such places invariably had stables with superior feed bins . There was Wright's , for one , lost amongst trees , its wide verandas strewn with rockers . Many of its sojourners were devoted to seclusion and quiet , and lived there to the end of their days . It was the haunt of writer Ambrose Bierce , who admired its redwoods . Acorns from the great oaks fed the small black pigs ( akin to Berkshires ) , whose `` carcass sweepstakes '' were renowned . Their ham butts , cured in oak-log smoke , were also esteemed when roasted or boiled , and served with this original sauce : Wright's devil sauce ; ; put into a saucepan a cupful of the baked ham gravy , or of the boiled ham liquor , with a half stick of butter , three teaspoonfuls of made mustard , and two mashed garlic cloves . Contribute also an onion , a peeled tomato and two pickled gherkins , and a mashed lime . After this has simmered an hour , add two tablespoons each of Worcestershire , catsup , and chutney , two pickled walnuts , and a pint of Sherry . Then simmer fifteen minutes longer . Every winter a kegful of this sauce was made and placed at the end of a row of four other kegs in the cellar , so that when its turn came , it was properly mellowed . Vineyards and orchards also grew around Wright's , and deer were rather a nuisance ; ; they leaped six-foot fences with the agility of panthers . But no one complained when they wound up , regardless of season , in venison pies . No one complained of the white wine either : at this altitude of two thousand feet , grapes acquire a dryness and the tang of gunflint . ( The Almaden vineyards have now climbed to this height . ) Apple trees grew there also . Though creeks in the Santa Cruz mountains flow brimful the year round and it is forever spring , the apples that grow there have a wintry crackle . Dwellers thereabouts preferred to get their apple pies at the local bakery , which had a brick oven fired with redwood billets . The merit of the pie , Vernon believed , was due more to its making than to the waning heat of the oven . The recipe , which he got from the baker , and wrote down in his ledger , is basically this : Wright's apple pie ; ; peel , core , and slice across enough apples to make a dome in the pie tin , and set aside . In a saucepan put sufficient water to cover them , an equal amount of sugar , a sliced lemon , a tablespoonful of apricot preserve or jam , a pinch each of clove and nutmeg , and a large bay leaf . Let this boil gently for twenty minutes , then strain . Poach the apples in this syrup for twelve minutes , drain them , and cool . Set the apples in the pastry-lined tin , spread over them three tablespoonfuls of softened butter , with as much brown sugar , a sprinkling of nutmeg , and a fresh bay leaf , then lay on a cover of pastry , and gild it with beaten yolk of egg . Those who have never traveled the width and length of this land cannot conceive , on the basis of textbook description alone , the overwhelming space and variety of this country held together under one government . The miracle of democratic America comes home to one most strongly only when one has seen the endless Great Plains of the Midwest ; ; the sky-reaching peaks of the Northwest mountains ; ; the smoke-filled , art-filled , drama-filled life of the great cities of the East ; ; the lush and historic charm of the South . Now , to add to the already unbelievable extremes found in one nation , we have the two new states of Hawaii and Alaska . To hope to cover just one region of this land and to enjoy all of its sights and events and , of course , to bring back pictures of your experiences , requires advance planning . For this reason , U.S. Camera has prepared this special U.S.A. vacation feature . We divided the country into five regions plus Hawaii and Alaska and in each is included a general description of the area plus specific recommendations of places and events to cover . Any special photographic requirements are also given . Use this section to plan now to make the most of your vacation in photogenic America . The Northeast birthplace of the nation , the Northeast offers historic battlefields ; ; lovely old villages and a rugged seashore among its many worthwhile sights . The rolling farms of Maryland , the peerless metropolis of New York City , the verdant mountains of Vermont can all be included in your Northeast vacation . By automobile from New York , for example , you can take a one or two-day tour to Annapolis , Maryland to see the colonial homes and the U.S. Naval Academy ( where you can shoot the dress parade on Wednesdays ) ; ; to Washington , D.C. , for an eye-filling tour of the city ; ; or to Lancaster , Pa. , the center of the Pennsylvania Dutch country ; ; Philadelphia with its historic buildings and nearby Valley Forge ; ; to West Point , N.Y. , the famous military academy in a beautiful setting on the Hudson River . New England deserves as much of your vacation time as you can afford with such areas as Cape Cod providing wonderful beaches , artists' colonies and quaint townships . From here you can easily include a side trip to the old whaling port of Nantucket , Massachusetts , which looks just as it must have two centuries ago . At Sturbridge Village , Massachusetts , you'll find a completely-restored New England town . North to Acadia National Park , Maine , with views of a rockbound coast and dark , magnificent forests . One of the most exciting ways to end a Northeast vacation would be with a week in New York City . Return through New England , stopping for a visit to Lake Champlain where you can take a boat ride and go to Ethan Allen Park . There you'll witness a view which includes the Adirondack Mts. and the Winooski River . Now you're ready for a whirlwind sightseeing tour of America's most exciting city . The skyline , the bridges , Broadway , and the Staten Island ferry are only a few of the spots to put on your `` must '' list for New York City . Photographing in the Northeast Some tips for shooting in Northeastern locales : In New York City don't miss coverage of the United Nations . These striking , modernistic buildings on the East River are open to the public and every weekday guided tours are available . Pictures can be taken in the public areas and when on tours . However , the use of tripods is not allowed . Photos of Conference Rooms and the General Assembly Hall can be made when these rooms are not being used for meetings . Flash is allowed , subject to above restrictions . Around New England , you'll no doubt want a color shot of one of the picturesque lighthouses . Be careful here not to overexpose this subject since they are extremely bright and light-reflecting . In color , 1/50th of a second between Af and Af will do for bright , frontal sunlight . The South the southern United States , extending from Florida in the east to Texas in the west , still maintains its unique flavor of gracious living and historical elegance . It encompasses in its expanse areas where the natural beauty encourages a vacation of quiet contemplation , on the one hand , to places where entertainment and spectacles of all sorts have been provided for the tourist with camera . Of special interest this anniversary year of the war between the states are the many Civil War battlefields where , likely as not , you'll catch some memorial re-enactments . Among the locales to visit are Shiloh , Tennessee ; ; Lookout Mountain , Tennessee ; ; Vicksburg , Mississippi ; ; Richmond , Virginia ; ; Petersburg , Virginia , and Fredericksburg , Virginia . Florida provides tropical scenes unequalled in the United States . At Cypress Gardens special bleachers are set up for photographers at water-ski shows and lovely models pose for pictures in garden settings . Silver Springs features glass-bottom boat rides and in Everglades National Park there are opportunities to photograph rare wildlife . Miami Beach and surroundings feature fabulous `` hotel row '' , palm-studded beaches plus the Miami Seaquarium and Parrot Jungle . One of the most delightful spots in a southern tour is the city of New Orleans . The famous old French and Spanish buildings with their elaborate wrought iron balconies and the narrow streets of the Latin Quarter present an Old World scene . For restoration of early American life the places to visit are Williamsburg , Jamestown and Yorktown , Virginia . Another Virginia sight and a photographic adventure are the Luray Caverns , lit by photofloodlights . The great state of Texas offers metropolitan attractions such as the Dallas Fair Park with its art and natural history museums . In contrast are the vast open stretches of ranch country and oil wells . In San Antonio visit the famous Alamo and photograph 18th Century Spanish buildings and churches . The Great Smoky Mountains is another area of the South well worth a visit . Along the 127-mile route through Great Smoky Mountains National Park you can photograph the breath-taking peaks , gorges and valleys which come into view at every turn . Gatlinburg , Tennessee , is the center of this area . Another scenic spot in Tennessee is Chattanooga where the Rock City Gardens are not to be missed . Beautiful homes and gardens are trademarks of the South and cities particularly noted for them are Charleston , S.C. , Natchez , Miss. , and Savannah , Ga. . At Charlottesville , Va. , shoot Monticello and the beautiful buildings of the University . Picturing the south Foliage is the outstanding photo subject in many of the Southern locales mentioned above and some specific tips on how and where to shoot it are in order . For example , the Chamber of Commerce of Gatlinburg , Tennessee , sponsors special camera tours into the Great Smoky Mountains to get pictures of the profusion of wild flowers flourishing in these wooded regions . Exposure problems may occur in these forest areas where uneven lighting results from shafts of sunlight filtering through the overhead branches . Best solution is to find an area that is predominantly sunlight or shade . In any instance , you should determine the exposure according to the type of light which falls on most of the subject area . Try some closeups on Southern blossoms to provide a welcome contrast with the many long-view scenics you'll be making . For shooting the interiors of the famous ante-bellum Southern mansions make sure your equipment includes a tripod . Enough daylight is usually available from the windows , but if you have synchronized flash -- use it . For some unusual photographic subjects , if your vacation takes you nearby , try these events : the 600-mile auto race in Charlotte , N.C. , , on May 27 ; ; the Florida Folk Festival , White Springs , May 5-7 ; ; Singing On The Mountain in Linville , North Carolina , on June 25 . Peak action photography is your goal at Miami's Seaquarium and the Cypress Gardens waterskiing events . The Midwest A pleasant start to your midwestern vacation is a few days spent in cosmopolitan Chicago . Lake Michigan offers swimming and pictures which combine cityscapes with beaches . A visit to Chicago's museums and a stroll around broad Michigan Avenue will unfold many photogenic subjects to the alert photographer . Wisconsin Dells , where fantastically scenic rocks carved by the Wisconsin River are overgrown with fern and other foliage , rates a stopover when traveling from Chicago . The farmlands forming the heart of America stretch out across the Midwest from Chicago . In North Dakota the strangely beautiful Badlands will challenge you to translate its wonder on to film . While here , visit Theodore Roosevelt National Park for its spectacular scenery . Another spot with an image-provoking name is the Black Hills where you can visit the old frontier mining town of Deadwood . The Black Hills Passion Play is produced every summer and is a pageant worth seeing and shooting . Of course , while in this vicinity you won't want to miss a visit to Mount Rushmore National Memorial where on the side of a mountain are the famous sculptures of Presidents Washington , Lincoln , Jefferson and Theodore Roosevelt . In Missouri ( which we are including in our general Midwest region ) you can glance into Mark Twain's birthplace at Hannibal , see the landmarks of his life and writings and visualize where Huck Finn hatched his boyish mischief . Similarly in Illinois there is Lincoln country to be seen -- his tomb and other landmarks . Minnesota , fabled land of waters , is in itself , ideal vacationland , having within its borders 10,000 lakes ! Itasca State Park , where the Mississippi River begins , is one of the outstanding tourist spots in Minnesota . Mementoes of the Old West recall the days of Wyatt Earp in Dodge City , Nebraska , where present-day cowboys add a colorful human interest note to your vacation shooting . Of current interest is Abilene , Kansas , the birthplace of ex-President Eisenhower . There's a museum here and also Old Abilene Town , a reconstruction of the cattle boomtown of the 70's and 80's . For a resort area , Mackinack Island , Michigan , is the place to visit . It truly relives another age for the inhabitants use carriages rather than autos and old British and French forts are left intact for tourists to visit and record . Pictures of the Midwest Night scenes will add an exciting touch to your vacation travelogue and what better place to take them then along Chicago's Lake Shore Drive ? Just after sunset is a good time to record the city lights in color since you get a `` fill-in '' light from the sky . Another memo for sightseers : bring your camera along to museums . Photos of historic dioramas of the area you visit will add depth and background to your vacation photo story . Again , be sure your tripod is handy for those sometimes-necessary time exposures . Special events and their dates which will make interesting shooting in the Midwest area , include the following : A re-enactment of the Battle of Lexington , May 18th at Lexington , Missouri ; ; the world-renowned 500-mile auto race at Indianapolis , Indiana , plus a festival from May 27-30 ; ; `` Song Of Hiawatha '' , in Elgin , Illinois , from June 20 to 24th . Michigan offers the lovely Tulip Festival in Holland , Michigan , May 12-14 ; ; the USGA Open in Birmingham from June 15-17 ; ; and the International Freedom Festival in Detroit , June 29 thru July 4 . For early vacationers there's the fun-filled Fishing Derby in Hot Springs , Arkansas , April 19-23 , and the Arkansas Band Festival in Hot Springs , April 20-22 . The West A western vacation is practically synonymous with a visit to at least one of the magnificent national parks in this area . A tour of several of them is possible in a two-week vacation while a stay at just one of these natural beauty spots can be of equal reward . In California is located one of the most popular of the national parks -- Yosemite . Among its most spectacular features are its falls , the highest being Upper Yosemite which drops 2,425 feet . The Sequoia Grove presents another unique aspect of Yosemite , for these ancient giant trees are a sight never to be forgotten . In the Utah area are Zion National Park and Bryce Canyon National Park . Fantastic colors are to be seen in the fanciful formations of eroded rock which loom out of the semiarid country in both parks . Colorado's Grand Canyon , probably the most famous landmark of the United States , can be the highpoint of your Western vacation . Built upon seven hills , Istanbul , like Rome , is one of the most ancient cities in the world , filled with splendor and contrast . It is an exotic place , so different from the ordinary that the casual tourist is likely to see at first only the contrast and the ugliness of narrow streets lined with haphazard houses . At the moment , many of these are being pulled down . Whole blocks are disappearing and more are scheduled to vanish to make room for wide boulevards that will show off its treasures to better advantage -- the great domes and graceful spires of its mosques , the panorama of the Bosphorus and the Golden Horn . Even when they are finished , however , the contrast will remain , for Istanbul is the only city in the world that is built upon two continents . For almost 3,000 years Europe and Asia have rubbed shoulders in its streets . Founded in the Ninth Century B.C. it was called Byzantium 200 years later when Byzas , ruler of the Megarians , expanded the settlement and named it after himself . About a thousand years after that , when the Roman Empire was divided , it became capital of the Eastern section . On May 11,330 , A.D. , , its name was changed again , this time to Constantinople after its emperor , Constantine . In 1453 when the last vestige of ancient Roman power fell to the Turks , the city officially shifted religions -- although the Patriarch , or Pope , of the Orthodox Church continued to live there , and still does -- and became the capital of the Ottoman Empire . When that was broken up after the First World War , its name was changed once more . Rich in Christian and Moslem art , Istanbul is today a fascinating museum of East and West that recently became a seaside resort as well with the development of new beaches on the Bosphorus and the Sea of Marmara only a short distance from the center of town . Easy to get to , and becoming more popular every year , it is only fourteen hours from New York by Pan American World Airways jet , four hours from Rome . Start of tour Most of the sights lie in the old section across the Golden Horn from the modern hotels . I started my tour of them at the Turkish Government Tourist Office , next to Pan American's office on the left as you enter the driveway that leads to the Hilton Hotel . From there I turned left along Cumhuriyet Cadesi past more hotels and a park on the left , Republic Gardens , and came in a few moments to Taksim Square , one of the hubs of the city , with the Monument of the Republic , erected in 1928 , in its center . Directly across from the Gardens I found a bus stop sign for T 4 and rode it down to the Bosphorus , with the sports center on my left just before I reached the water and the entrance to Dolmabahce Palace immediately after that . There the bus turned right along the Bosphorus , past ocean liners at anchor , to Galata Bridge over the entrance to the Golden Horn , a brown sweep of water that empties into the Bosphorus . Across the bridge on the left I saw St. Sophia with its sturdy brown minarets and to the right of them the slenderer spires of the Blue Mosque . On the other side of the Golden Horn I rode through Eminonu Square , with Yeni Cami , or the New Mosque , which dates from the Seventeenth Century , just across from the entrance to the bridge . Passing it , the bus climbed a hill , with the covered spice bazaar on the right and Pandelli's , a famous and excellent restaurant , above it . At the top of the hill the buildings on the left gave way to a park . I got off there , crossed the street , walked ahead with St. Sophia on my left , the Blue Mosque on my right , and in a moment came to the entrance of St. Sophia . Erected on the site of pagan temples and three previous St. Sophias , the first of which was begun by Constantine , this fourth church was started by Justinian in 532 and completed twenty years later . On his first trip to the finished structure he boasted that he had built a temple grander than Solomon's in Jerusalem . A few years later the dome fell in . Nevertheless , it remained one of the most splendid churches of the Eastern Empire , where the Byzantine Emperors were crowned . After the Turks conquered the city in 1453 they converted it to a mosque , adding the stubby minarets . In the second half of the Sixteenth Century , Sinan , the great architect who is the Michelangelo of the East , designed the massive buttresses that now help support the dome . With the birth of the Turkish Republic after the First World War , St. Sophia became a museum , and the ancient mosaics , which were plastered over by the Moslems , whose religion forbids pictures in holy places , have been restored . Inside over the first door I saw one of these , which shows Constantine offering the city to the Virgin Mary and Justinian offering the temple . On the columns around the immense dome are round plaques with Arabic writing . The eight green columns , I learned , came from the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus , the others , red , from the Temple of the Sun at Heliopolis . Beneath the dome I saw the spot where the Byzantine Emperors were crowned , a bit of floor protected now by a wooden fence . Behind this is a minber or Moslem pulpit and near it a raised platform with golden grillwork , where the emperors and , after them , the sultans , sat . Directly opposite is the emperor's door , through which they entered the building . Outside St. Sophia I walked through the flower garden in front of it , with the Blue Mosque ahead on my left . Across the street on my right I saw the Hippodrome , now a park . It was laid out in 196 for chariot races and other public games . Statues and other monuments that stood there were stolen , mostly by the waves of Crusaders . At the beginning of the Hippodrome I saw the Kaiser's Fountain , an ugly octagonal building with a glass dome , built in 1895 by the German Emperor , and on my left , directly across from it , the tomb of Sultan Ahmet , who constructed the Blue Mosque , more properly known by his name . Just before coming to the mosque entrance I crossed the street , entered the Hippodrome , and walked ahead to the Obelisk of Theodosius , originally erected in Heliopolis in Egypt about 1,600 B.C. by Thutmose , who also built those now in New York , London and Rome at the Lateran . This one was set up here in 390 A.D. on a pedestal , the faces of which are carved with statues of the emperor and his family watching games in the Hippodrome , done so realistically that the obelisk itself is included in them . Beyond it I noted a small green column , about twelve feet below the present ground level -- the Serpentine Column , three entwined serpents , which once stood at the Temple of Apollo at Delphi , Greece . Near the end of the Hippodrome I came upon the Built Column , a truncated obelisk of blocks , all that remains of a monument that once rivalled the Colossus of Rhodes . Magnificent Mosque Retracing my steps to the Mosque of Sultan Ahmet , only one with six minarets , I entered the courtyard , with a gallery supported by pointed arches running around it and a fountain in the middle . One of the most beautiful buildings in Istanbul , it was constructed in the early years of the Seventeenth Century , with a huge central dome , two half domes that seem to cascade down from it , and smaller full domes around the gallery . The round minarets , tall and graceful , rise from rectangular bases and have three platforms from which the muezzin can chant his call to prayer . Inside , the walls are covered with blue and white tile , the floor with red and cream carpets . Back at the Kaiser's Fountain , I walked left to the streetcar stop and rode up the hill -- any car will do -- past the Column of Constantine , also known as the Burnt Column , at the top on my right . It stands in the middle of what was once the Forum of Constantine , who brought it from Rome . I stayed on the car for a few minutes until , turning right , it entered a huge square , Bayezit , with the Bayezit Mosque on the right and the gate to the university just beyond it . There I got off , crossed the square , and on the side directly opposite the gate found a good restaurant , hard to come by in this part of the city . Called the Marmara Gazinosu , it is on the third floor , with signs pointing the way there , and has a terrace overlooking the Sea of Marmara . After lunch , in the arcade on my left just before reaching the street I found a pastry shop that sells some of the best baklava -- a sweet , flaky cake -- in Istanbul . It's a great favorite of the university students , and I joined them there for dessert . Taking the streetcar back to Kaiser's Fountain , I walked ahead , then left down the street opposite St. Sophia and just beyond the corner came to a small , one-story building with a red-tile roof , which is the entrance to the Sunken Palace . Actually an underground cistern , its roof supported by rows and rows of pillars , it was built by Justinian in the Sixth Century to supply the palace with water . There is still water in it . I found it fairly depressing and emerged almost immediately . Outside I walked past the entrance to St. Sophia , turned left at the end of it , and continued toward a gate in the wall ahead . Just before reaching it I came to a grey and brown stone building that looks somewhat like an Oriental pagoda , with Arabic lettering in gold and colored tile decorations -- the Fountain of Sultan Ahmet . Going through the Imperial Gate in the wall , I entered the grounds of Topkapi Palace , home of the Sultans and nerve center of the vast Ottoman Empire , and walked along a road toward another gate in the distance , past the Church of St. Irene , completed by Constantine in 330 A.D. on my left , and then , just outside the second gate , I saw a spring with a tap in the wall on my right -- the Executioner's Spring , where he washed his hands and his sword after beheading his victims . Passing through the gate , with towers on either side once used as prisons , I entered a huge square surrounded by buildings , and on the wall to my right found a general plan of the grounds , with explanations in English for each building . There are a good many of them . At one time about 10,000 people lived there . Following arrowed signs , I veered right toward the former kitchens , complete with chimneys , which now house one of the world's greatest collections of Chinese porcelain and a fabulous array of silver dinner services . Next to it is a copper section , with cooking utensils and a figure of the chief cook in an elaborate , floor-length robe . In the court once more , I went right toward the Reception House , a long one-story building with a deep portico . Going through a door into another small court , I had the Throne Room directly in front . I walked to the right around it to buildings containing illuminated manuscripts and came to the Treasury , which houses such things as coffee cups covered with diamonds , jewelled swords , rifles glittering with diamonds and huge divan-like thrones as large as small beds , on which the sultans sat cross-legged . They are made of gold and covered with emeralds , pearls and other jewels . Taking the path behind the Throne Room to the building directly beyond it , the Portrait Gallery , I went right at the end of it , through a garden to a small building at the back -- a sitting room furnished with low blue divans , its floor covered with carpets , its ceiling painted with gold squares and floral designs . ( Do start fires one or two hours ahead of time to obtain a lasting bed of glowing coals . Keep ashes from one barbecue to the next to sprinkle over coals if they are too hot , and to stop flames that arise from melting grease . Do line barbecue fire bowl with heavy foil to reflect heat . Don't forget to buy a plastic pastry brush for basting with sauces . Clean it meticulously in boiling water and detergent , rinse thoroughly . Do build a wall of glowing coals six to eight inches in front of meat that is barbecued on an electric spit . Make use of the back of the barbecue or of the hood for heating vegetables , sauces and such . Don't fail to shorten cooking time by the use of aluminum foil cut slightly larger than the surface of steaks and chops . Sear on both sides then cover meat loosely with heat reflecting foil for juiciest results . Do avoid puncturing or cutting into meats to test them . If doubtful about a steak , boldly cut it in half . If necessary to replace both halves on grill , sear cuts and allot extra time . For roasts , insert meat thermometer diagonally so it does not rest on bone . Also make sure thermometer does not touch the revolving spit or hit the coals . Don't practice a new recipe on guests . Have a test-run on the family first , to be sure timing and seasoning are right . Do buy meat the day or the day before you intend to cook it . Keep it no longer than 36 hours before cooking , and keep it in the coldest ( but non-freezing ) compartment of the refrigerator . Don't plan meals that are too complicated . Limit yourself to good meat and drink , with bread , salad , corn or potatoes as accessories . Keep the desserts simple ; ; fruit does nicely . Do whatever kitchen work , such as fixing a salad , preparing garlic bread , or making a marinade sauce , ahead of time . When you start the outdoor performance , you can stay outdoors without a dozen running trips into the kitchen . ( This goes for getting a drink tray ready , and for having a big cooler full of ice on hand long before the party begins . ) Don't think you have to start with the most expensive equipment in the world . The simplest grill ( pan type ) or inexpensive hibachi can make you a chef . You need tongs to handle meat ; ; long forks for turning potatoes and corn ; ; heavy foil on hand at all times . And lots of hot pads ! Do keep the grill high enough above the fire so that when fat from meat drips down and flares up , flames cannot reach the meat . Don't forget to have a supply of Melamine plates , bowls , cups , saucers , and platters for outdoor use . Made of the world's toughest unbreakable plastic , Melamine dinnerware comes in almost 400 different patterns and dozens of colors . There is even one set that has `` barbecue '' written on it . Do without fancy tablecloths . It's cheaper to buy Wall-Tex and cover your outdoor table . Or buy half a dozen lengths of oilcloth and change patterns for different kinds of barbecues . Oilcloth only costs about 79-cents a yard for the very best . Tougher than plastic , it wears well . Don't forget -- when you take to the hills or the beach -- that your cooler , which you might have used for wine- or beer-cooling on your terrace or back yard , is indispensable for carrying liquid refreshments . There are many varieties of coolers and they serve many purposes . With them , you can carry steaks and hamburgers at refrigerator temperatures , and also get your frozen food for stews and chowders , to the marina or picnic , in A-1 condition . Do use paper napkins ; ; lots of them . Except when you prepare `` do it yourself '' shish kebob or a lobster roast . Then you'll want terry cloth towels for mopping up . Don't think barbecue cooking is just sometimes , or seasonal . It's year-round , and everywhere . In the winter , hibachi in the kitchen or grill over the logs of the fireplace . Even use your portable electric or gas grill in the winter , inside . Summertime supper , outside , is a natural . You'll find , once your technique is perfected , that you can cook on a boat with a simple Bernz-O-Matic . Do buy all-purpose mugs or cups . Get copper or earthenware mugs that keep beer chilled or soup hot . Be sure to get a few more than you need . You will discover you keep the sauce for basting meat in one , use six for drinks , serve soup or coffee in another half-dozen -- and need one more to mix the salad dressing . Don't forget the joys of a meal on the road . If you travel over the vast U.S.A. you will , no doubt , discover that feeding is an expensive business . Decide in the beginning to put your barbecue equipment to work . You can take it with you . A picnic bag , a grill , a cooler for soft drinks and beer , and for frozen convenience foods . Eat in a restaurant or motel mornings and evenings ; ; or just evenings . Turn off at any one of the marked picnic areas ( gasoline companies have touring service bureaus that issue booklets on national parks to tell you where you have barbecue facilities ) and -- with soft drinks cooled from morning loading up , hamburger , buns , an array of relishes , and fresh fruit -- your lunch is 75% cheaper than at a restaurant , and 100% more fun . You need a little stove , a coffee pot and a stew pot ; ; maybe a skillet , a basket of essentials like salt , pepper , plates , forks , knives and a can opener . As you pull out of your motel or national park home-for-the-night , visit a market and buy just what you need for the next meal . For 25-cents load up the cooler with ice and keep cool pop in the car . Simple meat dishes spice is a fact of life in the U.S.A. . You only have to think of franks and sausages to know what I mean . Go a step further and list all the wonderful barbecue basics -- cervelat , salami , Vienna sausages , mettwurst , bratwurst , bockwurst , knackwurst , Bologna , pepperoni , blutwurst -- and you have a long list of easy specialties . Threaded on a skewer with new boiled potatoes , a bit of green pepper , a fresh white mushroom -- any one of these spiced meats makes a man a cook , and a meal a feast . Sure , for the most of us , a frankfurter is the favorite . A story goes that a certain Herr Feuchtwanger of St. Louis , around 1883 served his sausages ( grilled ) and mustard to his fancy customers . So that his customers should not soil their hands , Feuchtwanger issued white gloves . Discovery that the gloves frequently left with the customers made the wise peddler of spiced sausage-meat come upon a compromise . He had a bakery make buns sized to fit his franks . Years later , franks-in-buns were accepted as the `` first to go '' at the New York Polo Grounds . The nation's number one picnic treat is the skinless frankfurter -- toasted over a bonfire on the beach or , more sedately , charcoal broiled on a portable grill . Either way it's hard to beat in flavor as well as ease of preparation . To make the picnic frank come close to perfection , remember these tips : -- Score each frankfurter in four or five places about a third of the way through . This permits the juices to permeate the meat during cooking . -- Relishes are as vital to the success of the frank as are buns . Bring along the conventional ones -- catsup , pickle relish , mustard , mayonnaise -- plus a few extras , such as tangy barbecue sauce , chive cream cheese , or horse-radish for the brave ones in the crowd . -- Using a portable grill permits you to toast the buns , too . Watch closely while browning them , as it doesn't take long . -- An unusual flavor can be achieved by marinating the franks in French dressing or a mixture of honey , lemon juice and brown sugar prior to the picnic . Broil or toast as usual . Contrary to popular opinion , `` a la mode '' doesn't mean `` with ice cream '' -- it just means , in the latest style . Here are a couple of the latest , highly styled ways to fix skinless franks in your own back yard ! You'll have the neighbor's eyes popping as well as their mouths watering ! Jiffy barbecues 1 cup chili sauce 1/3 cup water 1 tablespoon barbecue sauce 2 teaspoons prepared mustard 1/2 pound chipped , spiced ham 6 sandwich buns , heated . Combine first 4 ingredients in saucepan ; ; heat thoroughly . Add ham ; ; heat . Serve on buns . Makes 6 barbecues . Hot hibachi franks You'll never hear `` sayonara '' , the Japanese word for goodbye , from your guests when you give a hibachi party . The fun of toasting their own sausages over the small Oriental charcoal burners and dipping them in tasty sauces will keep your group busy -- try it and see ! Canned cocktail frankfurters sweet-sour sauce 1 large onion , chopped fine 2 tablespoons salad oil 1 8-oz. can crushed pineapple and 1/2 cup of the juice 1/4 cup brown sugar 2 tablespoons vinegar 1 tablespoon prepared mustard 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce pineapple chunks . Mustard cream 2 tablespoons dry mustard Water 1/2 cup heavy cream , whipped Salt Paprika . Spear canned cocktail franks with picks . Also spear pineapple chunks and place in separate bowl . Make sauces ahead . Sweet-sour sauce can be kept warm over a second hibachi or chafing dish while charcoal in broiler is reaching glowing coal stage . Mustard cream , used as alternate dip for franks and pineapple tidbits , tastes best when served at room temperature . For sweet-sour sauce , cook onion in oil until soft . Add remaining ingredients and bring to a boil . Simmer about 10 minutes , and keep warm for serving . To prepare mustard cream , blend mustard with enough water to make a thin paste . Fold into whipped cream and add a dash of salt and sprinkling of paprika . Trim-your-own-franks A back-yard picnic with grilled frankfurters and a selection of frankfurter trimmings is a fine way to entertain guests this summer . Be sure to have plenty of frankfurters and buns on hand . Some tasty frank toppings are chili con carne , Coney Island sauce and savory sauerkraut . Serve the chili and kraut hot with the franks . Here are suggestions for the frankfurter trimmings : 1 . Chili con carne : use canned chili con carne . 2 . Coney Island sauce : finely chop several onions and add enough catsup to moisten well ; ; add prepared mustard to suit taste . 3 . Savory sauerkraut : add several tablespoons of brown sugar to a can of sauerkraut . Add a few caraway seeds , too , if you'd like . Barbecued frankfurters 1/2 cup minced celery 1/4 cup minced onion 1/2 cup tomato ketchup 1/2 cup water 1/4 cup vinegar 2 tablespoons brown sugar 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 1 tablespoon prepared mustard 1/2 teaspoon salt 8 frankfurters . Combine first 9 ingredients in skillet . Simmer 15 minutes . Prick frankfurters with fork ; ; place in sauce . Cover ; ; simmer 15 minutes , stirring occasionally , until sauce is of desired consistency . Serve in frankfurter buns or as a meat dish . Makes 8 sandwiches or 4 servings . Pretend ham Make criss-cross gashes on one side of skinless frankfurters . Stick 4 or 5 cloves in each frank , ham fashion . Make a paste of brown sugar and mustard and spread lightly over scored surface . If desired , sprinkle with 1 teaspoon drained crushed pineapple . Place on rectangle of foil and pinch edges together tightly . Roast on grill over coals 15-20 minutes . Frankfurter twists Blend 2 cups biscuit mix with 2/3 cup milk to make a soft dough . Knead on lightly floured board and roll out to form a Af-inch rectangle . Spread dough with a mixture of 3 tablespoons chili sauce , 1 teaspoon horse-radish and 2 teaspoons mustard . Cut dough carefully into 12 strips , about 3/4 inch by a foot long . Twist one strip diagonally around each skinless frankfurter , pinching dough at ends to seal it . Brush frankfurter twists with about 1/2 cup melted butter and toast slowly over glowing coals until dough is golden brown . Serves 12 . Hamburger patties with nuts 1 pound ground beef 2 teaspoons grated onion Dash of pepper 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup chopped walnuts 1/4 cup ice cold bourbon . Combine ingredients ; ; form into patties and barbecue 5 minutes on each side . Note : Directions are written for those who have had previous experience in making pottery . Instructions for preparing clay , drying , glazing and firing are not given . Equipment : Basic pottery studio equipment . Wooden butter molds and cookie presses . Materials : Ceramic modeling clay : red , white or buff . Stoneware clay for tiles . Glazes , one-stroke ceramic colors , stains , cones as indicated in the individual instructions . General directions : Use well-wedged clay , free of air bubbles and pliable enough to bend without cracking . Clean wooden molds and presses thoroughly ; ; they must be free of oil , wax and dust . Pressing designs : The size of wooden mold will determine the amount of clay needed . Roll clay to thickness indicated in individual instructions . Whenever possible , use the wooden mold as a pattern for cutting clay . When mold has more than one design cavity , make individual paper patterns . Place mold or paper pattern on rolled clay and cut clay by holding knife in vertical position ( cut more pieces than required for project to make allowance for defects ; ; experiment with defects for decoration techniques of glazes and colors ) . Place the cut clay piece loosely over the carved cavity design side of wooden mold . To obtain clear impression of mold , press clay gently but firmly into mold cavity , starting at center and working to outer edges . Trim excess clay away from outer edges . Check thickness of clay and build up thin areas by moistening surface with a little water and adding small pieces of clay . Be sure to press the additional clay firmly into place without locking in air bubbles . Allow project to stand for about five minutes ( if wooden press mold is a good antique , do not leave clay in too long as the dampness may cause mold to crack ) . To release clay from mold , place hands in a cupped position around project ; ; gently lift the edge on far side , then continue to release edge completely around mold . Slight tapping on the underside of mold will help release the clay , but too much agitation will cause the clay to become soft and will interfere with removal of clay from mold . Place a piece of plaster wall board or plaster bat on clay and reverse bat , clay and mold in one action . This will prevent the clay from twisting or bending , causing warping when fired . Place project on table and carefully lift the mold off . Study surface of clay for defects or desired corrections . If clay is slightly out of shape , square straight sides with guide sticks or rulers pressed against opposite sides , or smooth round pieces with damp fingers . If the background of design is too smooth , or you wish to create a wood-grained effect , it may be added at this time with a dull tool such as the handle of a fine paintbrush . Make slight , smooth grooves rather than cuts for the texture ( cuts could cause air pockets under the glaze creating pinholes or craters in the glaze during firing ) . Leave the clay on plaster board to dry slowly , covered lightly with a loose piece of plastic or cloth to prevent warping . Rectangular tiles ( opposite page , right top ) : Stoneware clay was used . Clay was rolled to 1/4'' '' thickness . Back of clay scored or roughened for proper gripping surface . No bisque firing . Glazed with two coats of Creek-Turn white stoneware glaze ( no glaze on sides or bottom ) . Decorated on unfired glaze with one coat of one-stroke ceramic colors ; ; raised details of designs were colored in shades of yellow-green , blue-green , brown and pink . Tiles were fired once to cone 05 . Round plaque ( opposite page , bottom ) : White clay was used , rolled to 1/4'' '' thickness . Bisque fired to cone 05 . Stained with Jacquelyn's ceramic unfired stain , polished , following manufacturer's directions . Opaque cantaloupe and transparent wood brown were used . No further firing . Paperweight ( opposite page , top left ) : Red clay was used , rolled 1/2'' '' thick . Mold was used as pattern and clay cut by holding knife at about 45-degree angle , to form an undercut , making base smaller than the pattern top . While clay is still pressed in mold , press three equally spaced holes 1/4'' '' deep , using pencil eraser , in bottom of clay to allow for proper drying and firing . Paperweight may be personalized on back while clay is leather hard . Bisque fired to cone 05 . Unglazed . Jars with lids ( opposite page , top left ) : Remove wooden design head from bowl of butter mold . Fill small hole in bowl with clay . Make paper patterns for sections of jar and lid ( see Fig. 1 , opposite page ) . Measurements for rectangular pattern piece A are obtained by measuring inside circumference and depth of butter mold bowl . Pattern for circular base piece B is diameter of Aj . Use wooden design head of mold for pattern C ; ; pattern D for lid fits over top diameter of Aj . Pattern for inner lid piece E fits inside Aj . Jars are assembled in bowl of butter mold . Use white or buff clay , rolled to 3/16'' '' thickness . Place patterns on rolled clay and cut around them with knife in vertical position . Place clay pieces on wall board . To assemble jar , put paper pattern B for base in bottom of mold and clay disk B on top . Line sides of mold with paper pattern Aj . Bevel and score ends of clay piece A so that they overlap about 1/2'' '' and make even thickness . Place clay piece A inside ; ; use slip to join overlapped ends together . Join B to bottom of A , scoring and reinforcing with clay coil . Trim excess clay from around lip of mold and set aside while assembling lid . To assemble lid , press clay piece C in cavity of wooden design head . Press clay into mold as instructed in General Directions . Score plain side of C and leave in mold . Score one side of disk D , join to C ; ; score other side of D and one side of disk E and join as before . While assembled lid is still on design head , gently but firmly press it on plaster board . If design head has a deep cavity , clay lid will be quite thick at this point ; ; press eraser of pencil gently 1/4'' '' deep into deep clay to allow vent for proper drying and firing . Check fit of lid on jar ; ; if inner lid is too big , trim to fit , allowing room for thickness of glaze . Remove lid from head of mold . Remove jar from mold . Place jar on plaster board with lid in place to dry slowly . Bisque fire to cone 08 with lid on jar . For an antique effect on jars , brush Creek-Turn brown toner on bisque ware and sponge it off . Glaze with two coats of clear or transparent matt glaze . The large jar was brushed with Creek-Turn green toner and sponged off . Glaze with two coats of matt glazes in turquoise with touches of blossom pink on lid . When dry they were fired to cone 06-05 . Little folks set : ( Made from modern wooden molds Af . ) Roll white clay to 3/16'' '' thickness . Salt and pepper : Use mold to cut four side pieces . For top and bottom pieces , use short end of mold as measurement guide . Press the side pieces of clay into cavity of mold . Trim excess clay from rim of mold . Cut beveled edge on the long sides of clay at a 45-degree angle to miter corners . Score beveled edges and remove pieces from mold ; ; place design-side up on plaster board . Make all four sides . Cut clay top and base pieces ; ; place on plaster board . Allow all pieces to become leather hard before constructing shaker . To assemble : Construct sides , bottom and top as for box , using slip on scored edges and coils of clay to reinforce seams . Join the four sides together first , then add the base ; ; add top last . Use water on finger to smooth seams and edges . Turn shaker upside down . Recess base slightly to allow room for stopper . Cut hole in base for cork stopper . Add holes in top , forming `` S '' for salt and `` P '' for pepper . Set aside to dry thoroughly . Sugar and creamer : Cut a strip of clay for sides long enough and wide enough for three impressions of mold design . Press clay into cavity of one mold three times ; ; bevel overlapping ends for splice joint , score beveled edges . Form clay strip into a cylinder ; ; use slip to join scored ends . Place cylinder on a disk of clay slightly larger than cylinder . Score bottom edge of cylinder and join to disk with slip . Trim away excess clay ; ; reinforce seam with a coil of clay . This will form the sugar bowl . Make creamer the same . Handle for creamer is a strip of clay 1/2'' '' wide and 3-1/2'' '' long . To add handle , place a wooden dowel against the inside wall of creamer . Score outside of container where handle ends will be joined . Bend handle ; ; press scored handle ends firmly in place using dowel to reinforce container while pressing ; ; use slip to join . To form spout , between two designs , dampen area slightly and gently push clay outward . Make lid for sugar bowl the same as jar lids , omitting design disk . Cut a notch in lid for spoon handle if desired . Set aside to dry with lid on sugar bowl . Vases : Make same as salt and pepper shakers , leaving off top pieces . Vases may be made into candles by filling with melted wax and a wick . Napkin holder : Cut a piece of clay for base and two for sides each about Af ( long enough for three impressions of mold ) . Press the two sides into cavity of one mold three times . Put cut pieces on plaster board to dry to firm leather-hard state . Score side edges of base ; ; join sides and base with slip and reinforce with coil . A cardboard pattern cut to fit inside holder will help to prevent warping . Place pattern inside holder ; ; use three strips of clay to hold in place ( see Fig. 2 , page 71 ) . Do not use wood as it will not shrink with the clay and would cause breakage . Let all projects dry slowly for several days . Clean greenware . Bisque fire to cone 08 . Inside of pieces was glazed with three coats of Creek-Turn bottle green antique glaze . Outside was finished with Creek-Turn brown toner brushed on and sponged off to give antique finish . Fired to cone 06-05 . Changing colors to change from one color yarn to another : When changing from one color to another , whether working on right or wrong side , pick up the new strand from underneath dropped strand . Photograph shows the wrong side of work with light strand being picked up under dark strand in position to be purled . To measure work : Spread article on flat surface to required width before measuring length at center . Measuring armhole to measure armhole : Mark row on which first stitches have been bound off for armhole by drawing a contrasting colored thread through it . Place work on a flat surface and smooth out . Measure straight up from marked row . See illustration . To insert markers : When directions read `` sl a marker on needle '' , put a small safety pin , paper clip , or commercial ring marker on needle . In working , always slip marker from one needle to another . To mark a row or stitch , tie contrasting thread around end of row or stitch to be marked . Backstitching seam to sew seams with backstitch : Most seams are sewn with backstitch , especially on curved , slanted or loose edges . Pin right sides of pieces together , keeping edges even and matching rows or patterns . Thread matching yarn in tapestry needle . Run end of yarn through several stitches along edge to secure ; ; backstitch pieces together close to edge . Do not draw yarn too tight . See illustration . To sew in sleeves : Place sleeve seam at center underarm and center of sleeve cap at shoulder seam . Ease in any extra fullness evenly around . Backstitch seam . Weaving seam to weave seams together : Straight vertical edges , such as those at the back seam of a sock , can be woven together invisibly . Thread matching yarn in tapestry needle . Hold edges together , right side up . Hotei is 23 feet long with an 8-1/2-foot beam and every inch a family boat . Menfolk can ride in the forward cockpit where the helmsman has a clear view . Youngsters can sleep or amuse themselves safely in the large cabin which has 5-foot 11-inch headroom , bunks for three , galley and marine toilet . The gals can sun themselves in the roomy aft cockpit . All are well distributed , not crowded together near the stern . And with passenger weight shifted forward , Hotei levels off for speed under power of a Merc 800 . The 80-hp motor drives her at 25 mph with six aboard ! With only two aboard , Hotei does better than 27 mph -- and she gives a comfortable ride at this speed even in a three-foot chop . She also banks into a turn like a fine runabout -- not digging in on the outside to throw passengers all over the boat like many a small cabin cruiser . Nor is she a wet boat . We've been out in five-foot waves and stayed dry . A lot of thought went into storage space construction . There's a large compartment in the forward cockpit for charts and other items . The cabin has several shelves for small items and storage under the bunks for water skiis , life jackets , etc. . The aft cockpit has a Af storage bin over six feet long that doubles as a seat . On each side of the motor well there's storage for battery , bumpers , line and spare props with six-gallon gas tanks below . The well itself is designed to take two Merc 800's or 500's if you wish and there's room for a 25-gallon long-cruise gas tank below it . Needless to say , you can't build Hotei in a couple of weeks . Our building time was slightly over 400 hours -- but the total cost for the hull with Fiberglas bottom , sink , head and hardware was under $800 . A comparable manufactured boat would cost close to $3,000 . Consider what you have to earn to be able to spend the $3,000 and your building time is well worth it . A Gator trailer , Model 565 , is used to transport the boat to the waterways . This piece of equipment costs a little over $600 but it will save you that in mooring and hauling fees in a few years . All framing in Hotei is one-inch mahogany which , in the dressed state you buy it , is about the 13/16-inch thickness specified in the drawings . Therefore , the lumber is bought in planks and ripped to size for battens , etc. , on a table saw . Besides flathead bronze screws , silicon bronze Stronghold nails ( made by Independent Nail & Packing Co. , Bridgewater , Mass. ) are used extensively in assembly and Weldwood resorcinol glue is used in all the joints . Construction follows a thorough study of the drawings . Start by laying out the six frames and the transom on a level floor . Draw each outline in a different-color chalk , one on top of the other . In this way you will be able to detect any obvious mistakes . The transom frame is made first with the joints lapped , glued and fastened with one-inch , No. 12 Stronghold nails . After notching it for the keelson , chines and battens , the half-inch plywood transom is secured to it with glue and the same type nails . All frames are butted at the joints and 3/8-inch plywood gussets are glued and nailed on each side of each joint , again using the one-inch , No. 12 nails . The frames are notched only for the keelson and the chines . If notched for the battens , they would require more work , be weakened and limber holes would have to be bored so that bilge water could flow through . Nowhere in the boat do the frames come in contact with the plywood planking . The jig is erected after the frames and transom are complete . This is an important step because any misalignment would cause progressively worse misalignment in the hull as you advance in construction . Be sure all members are parallel , vertical and level as required . After the frames and transom are set up on the jig and temporarily braced , a piece of three-inch-wide mahogany ( only widths will be given since the 13/16-inch thickness is used throughout ) is butted between frames one and two below the line of the keelson . The frames are glued and screwed to this piece . The joints are also reinforced on each side with small blocks set in resin-saturated Fiberglas cloth and nailed . It is over this piece that the laminated stem and keelson are spliced . The keelson , made of two three-inch widths , is next installed . The first piece is glued and screwed to the frames and transom and the piece butted between frames one and two . The second piece is in turn glued and screwed to the first . Note , however , that it is six inches shorter at the forward end . One-inch , No. 10 screws are used in both cases . A stem jig is next cut to the proper shape and temporarily fastened to frame one . The stem is laminated from four pieces . Take two three-inch-wide pieces and rip them down the center of the thickness to make the four . Then spread a generous amount of glue on the four pieces and bend them into place on the jig . The first two pieces butt against the inner member of the keelson and are glued and screwed to the brace between the first two frames . The second two pieces lap over the inner member of the keelson and butt against the outer member . They're glued and screwed to the inner member of the keelson . A number of C clamps hold the pieces together on the jig until the glue sets . All bottom battens are two inches wide . The side ones are a half-inch narrower . The battens are carefully fastened in place after some necessary fairing on all frames . Glue and 1-1/2-inch , No. 10 screws are used . Placement is important because the rear seat , bunks and front jump seats rest on or are fastened to many of the side battens . With the exception of two battens , all run to the stem where they are glued and screwed after careful beveling . The chines go in the same way except that they are made of two pieces of two-inch wood for strength and easier bending . Fairing is always a tedious job but the work can be cut down considerably with a Skill planer and a simple jig . I clamped a 30-inch piece of aluminum to the base of the planer with a pair of Sure Grips . The aluminum , flush against the battens , acted as a fairing stick and enabled me to plane the chines and keelson to the proper bevels easily . If you don't own a planer and don't want to buy one , it's well worth renting . The planking is five-ply , 3/8-inch-thick Weldwood Royal Marine plywood . This can be obtained in 42-inch widths 24 feet long . The 42-inch width leaves very little waste . Four pieces are used . Plank the sides first , using glue and one-inch , No. 12 Stronghold nails at all battens , the stem and the transom . Another person inside with a weight against each batten will help in the fastening . The best procedure is to have a few friends hold the planking in place while you mark it off . Then trim the excess . I used a Homemaster Routo-Jig made by Porter Cable for this job . It's good for cutting all the planking because it cuts with a bit-like blade at high rpm and does not chatter the plywood like a saber saw . When cut , the planking is clamped in place for a final and careful trimming . Then it is marked on the inside where it comes in contact with the transom , frames , keelson and all the battens . It may then be pre-drilled for the fastenings . The next step is to remove it and spread glue where it has been marked at the contact points . Then it is replaced and fastened . The bottom planking is applied in the same manner . After planking , the bottom gets a layer of Fiberglas . The spray rails are first glued on the outside and fastened from the inside with screws . Then the chines are rounded off and the bottom is rough-sanded in preparation . Since the sides are also covered up to the spray rails , they are also rough-sanded in that area . The cloth is laid on one half of the bottom at a time . A 50-inch width is used on each side and it laps the keel line by about three inches . Lay the cloth in place and trim it to size . Then remove it and give the whole bottom a coat of resin . When the resin has hardened , mix up another batch with a pigment added if you wish . I used bright red , mixing the pigment in thoroughly before adding the hardener . Using a cheap brush , coat one side of the bottom with the resin and then apply the cloth . When the cloth is smooth , apply another coat of resin , spreading it with a paint roller . Be sure it is well saturated and then allow it to harden . When the whole bottom has hardened , use a disk sander to feather the edges of the cloth at the keel line and near the spray rail . Then lay a three-inch-wide strip of cloth along the keel line from the transom to the point of the stem . Before the resin has hardened , screw a one-inch mahogany keel strip along the centerline . This protects the bottom in beaching . Fiberglas materials are available from Glass Plastic Supply Co. , 1605 W. Elizabeth Ave. , Linden , N. J. . They will also supply literature on application . The hull is now turned over ( with the help of about seven friends ) and placed in a level , well-braced position . I set it on the Gator trailer . I laid three layers of glass cloth on the inside of the stem , also installing a bow eye at this time . For added strength , I also fastened a small block on each side of every frame and batten joint . Again , these blocks were set in resin-saturated glass cloth and nailed . After trimming off the excess on the frames and transom which was used to fasten them to the jig at a working height , the top of the side planking is installed . This is made up of scraps left over from the sides and bottom . These flaring parts really help to keep the boat dry . When they're on , the top edges are planed even with the sheer batten . The sides of the motor well run from the bottom battens to the top and from frame six to the transom , forming a real strong transom brace . Note another piece of wood six inches wide is fastened to the transom between these pieces . The decking is quarter-inch mahogany marine plywood . All the flooring and the storage bin is half-inch exterior fir plywood . Most floor battens are glued and screwed to the flooring . The exception is where the flooring butts . These battens are glued and screwed to the frames . With all deck battens in place , the bilge is cleaned and painted up to the floor line . Use one coat of Firzite and one coat of marine paint . Bottoms of the floorboards are also painted and the flooring is then screwed in place . After the decking is on , the cabin sides are installed . They're followed by the front and rear bulkheads as illustrated . The windshield glass is shatterproof and Plexiglas is used in the cabin . Inside , bunks are framed up and installed as indicated . A head is a handy thing to have and I installed one under a removable section of the port bunk . The sink in the hinged panel above the bunk drains into the head and a five-gallon water tank is mounted on the bulkhead above the sink . For padding the seats and bunks , I used Ensolite , Type Aj . Lightweight , non-absorbent , fire resistant and dimensionally stable , it is easily bonded to the wood with contact cement . Available in Af sheets , it costs about a dollar a square foot . You can build this vacation cottage yourself . It is a full scale , small , but efficient house that can become a year 'round retreat complete in every detail . Because of the unique design by the architect Egils Hermanovski , you can build most of it in your own home workshop in your spare time . Most of it is panelized and utilizes standard materials , and requires the use of only simple tools . On the following pages and in the following issues we take you every step of the way to your vacation cottage , from choosing the proper site to applying the final trim . In recognition of the growing trend for second homes , or vacation cottages , we have designed this one specifically with the family handyman in mind . It is a big project , not to be taken lightly . But each step has been broken down into easy stages , utilizing standard materials and simple tools , well within the capabilities of the handyman . The theory The idea behind our design is modular units , or panelization . Everything possible has been scaled to standard sizes and measurements of materials . Wall panels and structural timbers are standard as are windows and doors , making for a minimum of cutting . We have developed an ingenious method of interlocking these so that you can make the major part of your house in your own workshop , panel by panel , according to plan . Thus , when you have prepared your foundation and laid the floor , these can be trucked to the site and erected with a small crew of friends in a weekend . The roof timbers are precut and the panels standard so that the house can be completely enclosed in a matter of three or four days . Then you can do the finishing touches at your leisure . A warning Due to the fact that building codes and regulations vary so much throughout the country , the first thing to do is to find out what , if any , they are . Close to a large city they might even specify the size of the nails used ; ; in a remote section there might be no restrictions at all . This can usually be found out at the nearest town hall . At the same time check the electrical , plumbing , and sanitary requirements , as well as possible zoning regulations . Whether electricity and public water and sewers are available or not , check the local customs in the use of bottled or L-P gas ( we give you alternatives later on ) . Be sure that this information is reasonably official and not just an unfounded opinion . If there are any major restrictions , they usually can be obtained in printed form . Where a building permit is required , find out what you must present when applying for one . In many cases , you must file a complete set of plans with the local building inspector . These will be available at cost from our Plans Department . The site Some general things to look for in a site , if you haven't already bought one , are accessibility , water drainage , and orientation . How are the roads , and how will they stand up ? Is there evidence of wash-outs on the property ; ; swampy areas or intermittent springs ? A visit in the early spring after a thaw will be very informative . Note where the sun rises and sets , and ask which direction the prevailing winds and storms come from . Will the view be something you can live with ? Don't worry too much about rocky or sloping terrain ; ; we will take up alternative foundations later on . The materials With this first issue we give you a list of the materials needed to build the basic ( AjA version ) and the expandable ( AjB version ) . This will be for the shell of the house only ( roof , walls , and floor ) , and does not include the carport or balcony . This will permit you to get a rough estimate of how much the materials for the shell will cost . Bear in mind that this does not include interior panels for partitions , fancy flooring , appliances and fixtures , electrical wiring , and plumbing , all of which will be taken up in detail in later issues . The wall panels are constructed of a framework of standard Af and Af of a good grade , free from structural faults . They should be as straight as possible , as this will effect their ability to mesh properly when the walls are erected . The outside surface of the solid units shall be of an exterior grade of panel board such as plywood , plastic coated panel board , high density particle board , asbestos-cement board , or any other product locally obtainable upon recommendation of your building supply dealer . The inner panels do not have to be weatherproof , and the choice will depend on the quality of finish desired . All panel board comes in standard Af foot size . It is recommended that panels be both glued as well as nailed to the frame . The fixed window panels with louvers should have a good grade of 1/8-inch double-strength glass set in a mastic glazing compound . The louvers are constructed as shown in the detail , with a drop door for ventilation . There are standard sliding glass windows in wood or aluminum frames for those panels requiring them . The door panels are designed to accommodate standard doors which should be of exterior grade . The filler panels for the gable ends are cut from full Af sheets as shown , leaving no wastage . The battens covering the joints are of Af stock and are applied after the walls are erected . All nails should be rustproof , and aluminum is highly recommended . Note : If 1/2-inch panel board is used inside and out , or 5/8-inch one side and 3/8-inch the other , and 1/8-inch glass is used , stock lumber in Af , Af , and Af can be used in making the glass panels . Other thicknesses may necessitate ripping a special size lumber for the glass trim . In any case , there is no special milling or rabbeting required for the panels . With modern techniques of woodworking and the multitude of cutting tools , fixtures , and attachments available , the drill press has become a basic home workshop tool . The drill press consists of a vertical shaft ( spindle ) which is tapered or threaded on one end to hold a drill chuck , a tubular housing ( quill ) in which the spindle is mounted , a head in which the quill is mounted , a feed lever which moves the quill up or down , a power source , and a movable table upon which the work is placed . There is often a means of locking the quill and , on larger presses , the table can be tilted . The size of the press is usually expressed in terms of chuck capacity ( the maximum diameter tool shank it will hold ) or distance between the spindle center and the column . A press with an 11 inch capacity lets you drill to the center of a 22 inch board or circle . A new radial drill press with a 16 inch capacity has a tilting head that allows drilling to be done at any angle . The head is mounted on a horizontal arm that swivels on the supporting column to position the drill bit instead of the work . Set-up and maintenance The drill press should be leveled and , depending on whether it is a bench or floor model , bolted securely to a sturdy bench or stand or screwed to the floor with lag or expansion screws . This will reduce vibration and increase accuracy . A coat of paste wax or a rubdown with a piece of wax paper will protect the polished surface of the table ; ; wiping with a slightly oiled cloth will discourage rusting of the column and quill . Presses not fitted with sealed spindle bearings will need a drop of oil now and then in the lubrication holes in the quill . The rest of the press should be kept clean by dusting with a clean rag or brush . Be careful to keep the drive belt free of oil and grease . Belt tension is adjusted by manipulation of two locking bolts and a movable motor mount . Keep the belt just tight enough so the pulleys won't slip when pulled by hand ; ; excess tension will only cause undue wear on the motor and spindle bearings . Most drill presses have a quill return spring that raises the spindle automatically when the feed lever is released and holds the quill in the raised position . The return spring tension may be adjusted to suit individual requirements by gripping the spring housing with a pair of pliers ( to prevent the spring from unwinding when it is released ) , loosening the lock nut or screw , and rotating the housing until the desired tension is achieved . Turning the housing clockwise will reduce tension , counter-clockwise will increase it . Don't lose the chuck key . Some manufacturers have had the foresight to provide a socket for the chuck key ; ; otherwise , you'll have to spend a few minutes to either attach a suitable spring clip somewhere on the press head or fit the key to a length of light chain and fasten to the bottom of the motor mount so that the key is out of the way when not in use . Feeds and speeds Drill speeds are important if you want a good job . Each cutting tool will operate best at a given speed , depending on the material worked . On most drill presses , it is impossible to get the exact speed , but you can come close by adjusting the drive belt on the step-cone pulleys . You will find a chart giving the various speed ratios available with your particular drill press somewhere in the instruction booklet that came with the tool . See the table on page 34 for exact recommended speeds . Generally , the larger the tool and the harder the material , the slower the speed . Feed pressure is also of major importance . Too much pressure will force the tool beyond its cutting capacity and result in rough cuts and jammed or broken tools . Too light a feed , particularly with metal or other hard material , causes overheating of the tool and burning of the cutting edge . The best results will be obtained by matching the correct speed with a steady feed pressure that lets the tool cut easily at an even rate . Common drilling tools There are numerous types and styles of tools to drill holes . The most common are the twist drill , the solid center shaft with interchangeable cutting blades , the double spur bit , and the power wood bit . All will do a good job if sharp , but the twist drills don't cut quite as smoothly as the others , since they do not have the outlining spurs that sever the fibers before actual boring starts . The adjustable fly cutter is very useful for cutting large diameter holes and can be used to cut exact-size discs by reversing the cutter blade . Since fly cutters are one sided and not balanced , they should be used at the slowest speed available , and fed very slowly to avoid binding . Fly cutters can fool you into putting your hand too close to the tool , so if you want to avoid nicked fingers , keep your hands well out of the way . Simple hole drilling operations When drilling all the way through a workpiece , always place a piece of scrap wood underneath . This will not only protect the work table , but also assure a clean breakthrough . Another method of assuring a clean hole is to first drill a small pilot hole all the way through , then drill half way with the dimensional bit , turn the piece over , and finish from the other side . In soft woods with pronounced grain , there is sometimes a tendency for the hole to wander , due to the varying hardness of the wood . In this case , drilling a small pilot hole or clamping the work will do much to improve accuracy . When a hole is to be bored to a predetermined depth , mark the depth on the side of the stock , then run the bit down so that it is even with the mark . The depth gauge rod can now be set , and any number of holes bored to exact and identical depth . The old-time bridges over the Merrimac River in Massachusetts are of unusual interest in many respects . For their length , their types of construction , their picturesque settings , and their literary associations , they should be known and remembered . In this sequence I shall write about them in the order of their erection . The first bridge known to have been covered wholly or in part , -- and perhaps the most interesting one , connected Newbury ( now Newburyport ) with Salisbury Point . Its building was first proposed in 1791 , when a group of citizens , mostly Newburyport men , petitioned the General Court for an act of incorporation . This document began : `` No. 1 Newbury Port , may 30th , 1791 `` Whereas , a Bridge over Merrimack River , from the Land of Hon'ble Jonathan Greenleaf , Esquire , in Newbery , to Deer Island , and from said Island to Salisbury , would be of very extensive utility , by affording a safe Conveyance to Carriages , Teams and Travellers at all seasons of the year , and at all Times of Tide . `` We , the Subscribers , do agree , that as soon as a convenient Number of Persons have subscribed to this , or a similar Writing , We will present a petition to the Hon'ble General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts , praying for an Act incorporating into a Body politic the subscribers to such Writing with Liberty to build such a Bridge , and a Right to demand a Toll equal to that received at Malden Bridge , and on like Terms , and if such an Act shall be obtained , then we severally agree each with the others , that we will hold in the said Bridge the several shares set against our respective Names , the whole into two hundred shares being divided , and that we will pay such sums of Money at such Times and in such Manners , as by the said proposed Corporation , shall be directed and required '' . This paper was signed by forty-five persons , subscribing a total of two hundred shares . A month later the General Court served notice to the town of Newbury that the bridge was to be built . The matter was considered and reconsidered , and finally opposed , but in spite of many objections , the Court granted a charter on January 9 , 1792 . On November 26 of that year the bridge was completed and opened . Timothy Palmer , who invented and later patented the arch type of construction for wooden bridges , was the genius who planned and supervised the building of the Essex , or `` Deer Island '' bridge although the actual work was carried out under the direction of William Coombs , who received $300 as recompense . This two-part bridge is best described by Rev. Timothy Dwight , president of Yale College , in his `` Travels In New-England And New-York '' , published in New Haven in 1821 . He says of it : `` It consists of two divisions , separated by an island at a small distance from the southern shore . The division between the island and this shore , consists principally of an arch ; ; whose chord is one hundred and sixty feet , and whose vortex is forty feet ( it was actually 37 feet ) above the high-water mark . In appearance and construction it resembles the Pascataqua bridge . The whole length of Essex bridge is one thousand and thirty feet and its breadth thirty-four . I have already mentioned that Mr. Timothy Palmer of Newburyport was the inventor of the arched bridges in this country . As Mr. Palmer was educated to house-building only , and had never seen a structure of this nature ; ; he certainly deserves not a little credit for the invention '' . It is hardly necessary to remind students of covered bridges that Timothy Palmer was born in 1751 in nearby Rowley ; ; that he moved with his parents to West Boxford when he was sixteen years old ; ; and was there apprenticed to a builder and architect , Moody Spofford . It was indeed a remarkable feat that a man who had had no experience of bridge building should have applied the principle of the arch , which appears in his famous bridges at Portsmouth , Haverhill , and Philadelphia . The Essex Merrimack Bridge when first built was not covered . As far as we know , no American bridge had been thus protected in 1792 . Richard S. Allen is the authority for the statement that the northern section was probably roofed by 1810 . Its original appearance is shown in an engraving published in the `` Massachusetts Magazine '' in May 1793 , which is reproduced herewith ( Fig. 1 ) . A brief description accompanying the picture says that the bridge contained more than 6000 tons of timber . Between the abutments on the Newbury shore and the south bank of Deer Island there was one span or arch measuring 160 feet ; ; between the north shore of Deer Island and the Salisbury side there was an arch of 113 feet and a series of piers with a draw forty feet long . A dinner and celebration in honor of this piece of engineering took place July 4 , 1793 , in a tavern erected by the corporation on the island . It is said that the eccentric Timothy Dexter , who was one of the first share-holders , stood on the table and made a speech worthy of the occasion . The `` Essex Journal '' says that he `` delivered an oration on the bridge , which for elegance of style , propriety of speech or force of argument , was truly Ciceronian '' . The reporter must have written this with tongue in cheek , because Dexter's oration could hardly be understood ; ; and , although he later explained that he was talking French , it seems rather more likely that he had succumbed to the joys of the evening . The north portion of the Essex bridge was well worth the cost of construction , although it proved to be twice what was estimated in the beginning . It stood in its original form until 1882 . The southern half , however , on account of its underbracing , was considered by boat owners a menace to navigation . In 1810 it was torn down and replaced by a chain suspension bridge . This was built by John Templeman from plans submitted by James Finley of Fayette County , Pennsylvania . Timothy Palmer had general supervision of the work . An advertisement in the `` Newburyport Herald '' , December 21 , 1810 , shows Palmer in a new light as an expert on chain bridges . It reads : `` chain bridges `` . Information is hereby given that Mr. Timothy Palmer of Newburyport , Mass. has agreed to take charge of the concerns of the Patentees of the Chain Bridge , in the states of Massachusetts , New Hampshire , Vermont , Rhode Island , and Connecticut , so far as relates to the sale of Patent rights and the construction of Chain Bridges . `` Mr. Palmer will attend to any applications relating to bridges and if desired will view the proposed site , and lay out and superintend the work , or recommend a suitable person to execute it . John Templeman `` Approved , Timothy Palmer '' . This chain bridge proved less durable than the wooden arch on the Salisbury end . It fell , February 6 , 1827 , carrying with it a horse and wagon , two men and four oxen . The horse and men were saved , but the oxen drowned . In spite of this catastrophe , the bridge was rebuilt on the same plan and opened again on July 17 , 1827 . This second chain bridge was 570 feet long , had two thirty-foot towers and a draw , and a double roadway . The Essex bridge was a toll crossing until 1868 , when the County Commissioners laid out all the Merrimack bridges as highways . Sturdy and strong after more than a century of continuous use , the old covered , wooden bridge that spans the Tygartis Valley River at Philippi will have a distinctive part in the week-long observance of the first land battle of the Civil War at its home site , May 28th to June 3rd . Colonel Frederick W. Lander , impersonated , will again make his break-neck ride down the steep declivity of Talbott's ( now College ) Hill and thunder across the bridge to join Colonel Benjamin F. Kelley's ( West ) Virginia Infantry , then swarming through the streets in pursuit of the retreating Confederates . He was closely followed by the Ohio and Indiana troops -- thus the old bridge has another distinction ; ; that of being the first such structure secured by force of arms in the war of the '60s . The bridge has survived the natural hazards of the elements , war , fire , and floods , as well as injuries incident to heavy traffic , for more than a hundred years . Twice during the Civil War it was saved from destruction by the opposing armies by the pleas and prayers of a local minister . It still stands as a monument to the engineering skills of the last century and still serves in the gasoline age to carry heavy traffic on U.S. Route 250 -- the old Beverly and Fairmont Turnpike . It is one of the very few , if not the only surviving bridge of its type to serve a main artery of the U.S. highway system , thus it is far more than a relic of the horse and buggy days . This covered , wooden bridge is so closely identified with the first action in the early morning of June 3 , 1861 , and with subsequent troop movements of both armies in the Philippi area that it has become a part and parcel of the war story . So frequently have pictures of the bridge appeared in books and in national publications that it vies with the old John Brown Fort at Harpers Ferry as the two nationally best known structures in West Virginia . Completed and opened for traffic in 1852 , the bridge was designed and built by Lemuel Chenoweth and his brother , Eli , of Beverly . The Chenoweth brothers were experienced bridge builders , and against the competition of other , and better known , bridge designers and builders they had constructed nine of the covered , wooden bridges on the Parkersburg and Staunton Turnpike a dozen years before , as well as many other bridges for several counties . The Philippi bridge , however , was the Chenoweth master piece , with its 139-foot , dual lane , span -- and it stands today as a monument to its builders . Never rebuilt , the bridge was strengtened in 1938 by two extra piers , a concrete floor , and a walk-way along the upper side in order to care for modern traffic . During the war it was in constant use by the wagon trains transporting supplies from the railhead at Grafton to the troops operating in the interior . Union soldiers at times used it for sleeping quarters to escape from the rain or other inclement weather , and some of them left momentoes of their stay by carving their names and small tokens on its walls and beams . But what the elements could not do was seriously threatened when Brigadier General William E. ( Grumble ) Jones reached Philippi while on the famous Jones-Imboden raid in May , 1863 . General Jones was fresh from a long series of bridge burnings , including the long bridge at Fairmont , and , after seeing a great drove of horses and cattle he had collected safely across the bridge , he sent his men to work piling combustibles in and around it . Reverend Joshual Corder , a Baptist minister , gathered a few citizens of Southern sympathies , to call on Jones and plead with him to spare the structure ; ; he reasoned and argued , pointing out that Jones or other Confederate commanders would need it should troops pass that way in retreat . Jones relented , he did not order his men to apply the torch -- the drove of livestock was driven up the valley , via Beverly , and across the mountains to feed and serve the Confederate army , while Jones and his raiders turned toward Buckhannon to join forces with Imboden . Again Reverend Corder saved the bridge when Union soldiers planned to destroy it , after filling its two lanes with hay and straw -- but for what reason is not recorded nor remembered , certainly not because of pressure from an opposing Confederate force . On the second occasion it took prayers as well as reason to dissuade the soldiers from their purpose . Centering around this historic old structure , a group of public-spirited Barbour County citizens have organized and planned a week-long series of events , beginning on May 28th and continuing through June 3rd , to observe most appropriately the centennial of the first land engagement of the Civil War at Philippi . It is a good eight years now since each of us acquired a swimming pool -- eight enlightening , vigorous , rigorous , not wholly unrewarding years . We have learned a lot -- a dash of hydrochemistry here , a bit about plumbing and pump-priming there . We have had sound grounding in the principles of the mailed-fist-in-velvet-glove school of diplomacy . We have become amateur insurance experts and fine-feathered yard birds . True , our problems have lessened a bit as more and more of our neighbors have built their own pools , thereby diluting our spectacular attractions . But problems cling to pools , as any pool owner knows . So our innate generosity of spirit prompts us to share our trials , errors and solutions with any who are taking the pool plunge for the first time -- in the pious hope that some may profit from our experience . Where to put it Position may not be everything , but in the case of a pool it can certainly contribute difficulties , social and/or physical . We speak from varying viewpoints . One of us has a pool set in a wooded area very near the house . The other has his pool far away from the house in a field high on a hill . If you are dreaming of a blue , shimmering pool right outside your living room windows , close your eyes firmly and fill in the picture with lots and lots of children , damp towels , squashed tubes of suntan oil and semi-inflated plastic toys . You are likely to be nearer the truth . You can also see that the greater the proximity of the pool to your main living quarters , the greater the chance for violation of family privacy , annoying noise and the let's-make-your-house-our-club attitude . On the other hand , out-of-sight does not lead to out-of-mind when children cannot be easily observed and you have to make a long trek to reach the pool . Another dilemma : As picturesque as a sylvan pond in the forest may be , trees offer a leaf and root hazard to the well-being of a pool . Yet a grassy approach can turn a pool into a floating lawn every time the grass is mowed . As in choosing a wife , it is only sensible to consider also how appealing a pool is likely to be in bad weather as well as in good . In the colder climes , for instance , you will have to live through the many unglamorous winter months when your pool will hardly look its best . It may be a big hole in the ground filled with salt hay , or an ice floe studded with logs . Even a neat , plastic-covered plunge is not exactly a joy to behold . ( We do , however , recommend those patented covers to prevent both people and junk -- flora and fauna generally -- from accidentally wintering in the pool . ) Probably no location for a pool is perfect on all counts . Naturally it will be dictated to a large extent by the shape and size of your land . But if space and money are no problem and small children are not on hand every day , it is certainly more restful to have your pool and entertainment area removed from the immediate environs of the house . And a good several feet around the pool should be neither greensward nor woods , but good hard pavement . The placement of your pool , however , will not of itself solve the two major problems of pool owning -- those that involve your social life and those pertaining to safety . Coping with them demands stern discipline -- of yourself as well as of your family , neighbors , friends and anyone you ever talked to on a transoceanic jet . Eight years ago while we were going through the mud-sweat-and-tears construction period , we were each solaced by the vision of early morning dips and evening home-comings to a cool family collected around the pool with a buffet table laid out nearby for the lord and master's delectation . But not even our first pool-side gatherings came anywhere near those rosy fantasies . We seemed to be witnessing the population explosion right in our own backyards . Our respective families looked as if they had quadrupled . Had we taken a lien on a state park ? Not at all . We had merely been discovered by the pool sharks . We were in business ! From proud pool-owners to perpetual hosts and handymen was a short step -- no more than the change from city clothes to trunks . Naive of us , maybe , but the results of our impulsive invitations to `` come over next summer and swim in our new pool '' were both unexpected and unsettling . Our book of etiquette After the first few weeks , it was obvious that rules had to be made , laid down and obeyed -- even if our popularity ratings became subnormal as a result . So rules we made , in unabashed collusion . Since our viewpoints in this respect coincided precisely , we present the fruits of our efforts herewith as a single social code for pool owners . First and foremost : No one -- no , not anyone -- in the family is allowed to issue blanket invitations to his or her own circle . Just short of forty lashes we finally managed to coerce our children to this view . Their friends and ours are welcome to share the pool , but on our terms and at our times . No friends are to arrive without an invitation or without at least telephoning beforehand . No ringers , either -- even if they are trailing legitimate invitees . We want to know when the Potlatches telephone exactly how many they are planning to bring , so that we won't end up with a splashing mob that looks like Coney Island in August . No young children may come without adults except for a specific , organized , chaperoned party . And accompanying adults are urged to keep an alert and sensible eye on their responsibilities . A gaggle of gabbling mothers , backs to the pool , is no safeguard . No bottle pool is tolerated -- bottle pool being our lingo for those who come to swim and sink into our bar while protesting that they can only dunk and run . ( Sanity , solvency and relations with our wine merchant took a beating that first summer as we inadvertently became the neighborhood free-drink stop . ) We designated one day a week as the time when neighborhood teen-agers might swim at definite hours . This has saved us from constant requests seven days a week and made us feel less brutal to the young `` less fortunate '' than ours . We also worked out logistics for Sunday afternoon swimmers who arrive two hours early with their weekend guests while we are still enjoying an alfresco lunch en famille . We gently usher them to an island of tables and chairs strategically placed on the far side of the pool where they can amuse each other until we get ready to merge sides . All dressing ( undressing to be more exact ) must be done in our small bath house or at the swimmers' homes . ( To avoid any possible excuse for a dripping parade through your house , it is a good idea to have a telephone extension near the pool as well as a direct outdoor route between the pool , and the parking area . ) We do , however , provide a limited number of extra suits , mainly for children , and we stock extra towels and a few inexpensive bathing conveniences . Life-preservers , the buckle-on kapok-filled kind , are held in readiness , too , for the very young . Preserving life and limb Safety rules , of course , are more important than all the others put together . In many localities , now , the law requires all pools to be fenced , usually to a minimum height of 5 feet . But fenced or unfenced , no pool-side is the place for running or horseplay . We allow no underwater endurance contests , either , or inexpert versions of water polo . Diving boards must have non-skid surfaces ( coco matting takes an awful beating from chlorine and rots quickly , but grit-impregnated paints are excellent ) . And divers must be enjoined to look before they leap , either on top of someone else or onto a pool edge . Our pools also have wide , shallow steps -- for the benefit of the littlest swimmers who can thus be introduced to the water with far greater safety than a ladder affords . All bottles must be kept a safe distance away from the pool and drinking glasses are banned in favor of plastic or metal cups . When you first acquire a pool , we earnestly recommend -- for your own mental health -- a good long chat with your insurance agent . You should be prepared to cope with any pitfall such as plunges into empty pools or shallow ends and all manner of winter as well as summer lawsuits . Soignee pools , alas , do not just happen . They are the result of a constant and careful contest with the elements . Unless you want to make your wife a pool widow and to spend a great many of your leisure hours nursing your pool's pristine purity , its care and feeding -- from pH content to filtering and vacuuming -- is best left to a weekly or bi-monthly professional service . Of course , if your pool is close to the house , your wife can always add it to her housekeeping chores ( you hope ) . Or you can make pool care the price of swimming for teen-agers . Even so , every pool owner , in case of emergency , should have some idea of what makes things work . A brief course in hydraulics from the pool builders may well be appreciated in a future crisis . Preserving the pool A sudden high rise in temperature will turn your pool poison green overnight . You need more chlorine . The walls feel slippery . You need algaecide . With or without professional help , you will have to be able to do some of these jobs yourself unless you have a full-time pool nurse . You should see to it that the trap , the dirt-catcher in front of the filter , is always clean . A pool is no place for a shut trap . You should firmly insist that no bobby pins or hair pins be worn in the water . When shed , they leave rust marks . You can hope against hope that come spring cleaning , your fair-weather friends will lend a hand at scrubbing and furbishing . It has happened . Many hours of spring cleaning will be saved , however , if you remove the main drain grate when you close the pool season in the fall . As the pool is emptied , stand by to brush down the walls and bottom while they are still wet . Much of the dirt and leaf stain is easily removed when damp , but requires dynamite if allowed to dry . If you have a 6- to 8-inch drain pipe , you may easily wash out all the debris when the grate is out . Of course , when your 6-inch torrent of water is released , it may cause a lot of comment as it passes through or by neighboring properties . Do not forget this possibility . If your pool is located on or near sloping ground , it may have natural drainage which is certainly more desirable than to be faced with the annual expense and labor of first pumping out the water and then scooping out all the debris . It may be true that pool lighting dramatizes an evening scene , but lights also attract all the insect life for miles around . Once on the water , these little visitors seldom leave , and this adds to your filtering and vacuuming problems as well as providing a slapping good time for all those present . Often one floodlight high in a tree will provide all the light you need at much less expense . Our experience has taught us that it pays to buy the best equipment possible , from pipes to brushes . Follow pool-care instructions to the letter , and be sure that one person ( in the family or not ) is regularly responsible for each aspect of the job , with no chance for claiming , `` It wasn't my turn '' . Never let anyone not in the know take a turn at the valves -- even if the little boys do want to play space ship . You may find yourself hitting bottom , literally , as you discover that water is running out even while you are putting it in . Draw a line across the country at the latitude of lower Pennsylvania . Any house built now below that line without air conditioning will be obsolete in 10 years . Fortunately , it is the FHA which has arrived at this conclusion , for it means that cooling equipment of all kinds may now be included in a mortgage , and thus acquired with a minimum of financial stress . Even if you live above that line , the FHA will back you , for they have decided that the inclusion of air conditioning in all new homes is a good thing and should be encouraged . New simplified packaged units , recently devised prefabricated glass-fiber ducts , and improved add-on techniques make it possible to acquire a system for an 1800-square-foot house for as little as $600 to $900 . Two men can often do the installation in a day . You can install it yourself -- this is a central system that will cool every part of your house . Its upkeep ? No less an authority than the FHA concurs that the savings air conditioning makes possible more than offset its operating costs . Is it worth-while ? ? Home air conditioning has come a long way from the early days of overcooled theaters and the thermal shock they inflicted . We know now that a 15-degree differential in temperature is the maximum usually desirable , and accurate controls assure the comfort we want . We know , too , that health is never harmed by summer cooling . On the contrary , there are fewer colds and smaller doctor bills . The filtered air benefits allergies , asthma , sinus , hay fever . Control of temperature and humidity is a godsend to the aged and the invalid . Heart conditions and high blood pressure escape the stresses brought on by oppressive heat . Housekeeping is easier . The cleaner air means less time spent pushing a vacuum , fewer trips to the dry cleaners , lighter loads for the washing machine . The need for reupholstering , redecorating , repainting becomes more infrequent . Clothes hold their shape better , and mildew and rust become almost forgotten words . It will improve your disposition . When you're less fatigued , things just naturally look brighter . The children can have their daytime naps and hot meals , and be put to bed on schedule in shade-darkened rooms . You'll sleep longer and better , too , awake refreshed and free of hot weather nerves . You can forget about screens , and leave the storm windows up all year around . Best of all , central air conditioning is something you can afford . Like its long-lived cousin , the refrigerator , a conditioner can be expected to last 20 to 25 years or more . That brings its per-year cost down mighty low . For any house . No matter what style your home is , ranch , two-story , Colonial or contemporary , central air conditioning is easily installed . The equipment won't take up valuable space either . It can go in out-of-the-way waste space . But there's no denying that the easiest and most economical way to get year-'round whole-house air conditioning is when you build . If that's done , the house can be designed and oriented for best operation , and this can mean savings both in the size of equipment and in the cost of the house itself . If you can't see your way clear to have summer cooling included when building , by all means make provision for its easy adding later . Manufacturers have designed equipment for just such circumstances , and your savings over starting from scratch will be substantial . If your house is to have a forced warm air system , cooling can be a part of it . This costs less than having a completely separate cooling system , for your regular heating ductwork , filters and furnace blower do double duty for cooling . You can get year-'round air conditioners in the same variety of styles in which you buy a furnace alone -- high or low boy , horizontal or counterflow . The units can be installed in basement , attic , crawlspace , or in a closet located in the living area . The cooling coil is located in the furnace's outlet . From the coil small copper pipes connect to a weatherproof refrigeration section set in the yard , garage , carport , or basement . If you plan to add cooling later to your heating system , there are things to watch for . Be sure ducts that require insulation get it when they are installed . They may be inaccessible later . Be sure your ducts and blower are big enough to handle cooling . This is especially important if you live in a mild-winter zone . Be sure you get a perimeter heating system , and diffusers that will work as well for cooling as they do for heating . You can get a hot water system that will also work for cooling your house . For cooling , chilled water is circulated instead of hot water . Instead of radiators you'll have cooling-heating units , each with its own thermostat . These systems are more expensive than year-'round forced air systems . The minimum cost for an average one-story , 7-room house with basement , is likely to run $1500 above the cost of the heating alone . Separate systems . If the problems of combining cooling with your heating are knotty , it may be cheaper to plan on a completely separate cooling system . The simplest kind of separate system uses a single , self-contained unit . It is , in effect , an oversize room conditioner equipped with prefab glass-fiber ducts to distribute the cooled , cleaned , dehumidified air where it is wanted . In a long , rambling ranch , two such units can be installed , one serving the living area , the other the sleeping zone . In a two-story house , one unit may be installed in the basement to serve the first floor , another in the attic to cool the second . In each case , having separate systems for living and sleeping areas has the advantage of permitting individual zone control . The heat pump . One of the more remarkable of the new cooling systems is one that can be switched to heating . As you know , a conditioner makes indoor air cool by pumping the heat out of it and then releasing this heat outdoors . A relatively simple switching arrangement reverses the cycle so that the machine literally runs backward , and the heat is extracted from outdoor air and turned indoors . Up until recently , this heat pump method of warming air was efficient only in areas of mild winters and when outside temperatures were above 40 degrees . Now , the machine has been improved to a point where it is generally more economical than oil heat at temperatures down to 15 degrees . You can get this added heating feature for as little as $200 more than the price of cooling alone . Consider it as a standby setup , at negligible cost , for those emergencies when the furnace quits , a blizzard holds up fuel delivery , or for cool summer mornings or evenings when you don't want to start up your whole heating plant . What size conditioner ? ? How large a cooling unit you need , and the method of its installation , depends on a variety of factors . Among other things , besides the nature of your house and how much heat finds its way into its various rooms from the outside , it will depend upon your personal habits and the makeup of your family . Families with children usually don't want the house quite so cool . If you are a party thrower , you may need added capacity . The body is a heat machine , and 20 to 25 guests can easily double your cooling load . Cooling requirements are best expressed in terms of Aj . A BTU is a unit of heat , and the BTU rating of a conditioner refers to how much heat your machine can pump out of your house in an hour . A very rough rule of thumb is that , under favorable conditions , you'll need 15 BTU's of cooling for every square foot of your house . This is if outdoor temperatures have a high average of 95 degrees . You'll need more if the high average is above that , less if it's below . Coolers are also rated by tons . A ton of cooling compares to the cooling you get by melting a ton of ice . By accepted definition , a 1-ton conditioner will provide 12,000 BTU of cooling in one hour . You may find a conditioner rated by horsepower . It is generally an inaccurate method of rating , for the horsepower is that of the compressor motor , and many other components beside it determine how much cooling you'll get . A 1-hp conditioner , for example , may vary in effectiveness from under 8,000 BTU to well over 10,000 Aj . The safest procedure is to let your builder estimate the size of the unit you need , rather than trying to do this yourself . Don't urge your builder to give you a little extra cooling capacity just to be sure you have enough . Better to have your equipment slightly undersized than too big . Here's why : Reducing humidity is often as important as cooling . An oversize unit will cool off your house quickly , then shut down for a long period . Before it cycles on again , humidity can build up and make you uncomfortable even though the temperature is still low . With a unit of the right size , a compressor will run continuously during hot weather , reducing humidity as evenly as it does temperature . Money-saving tips . Attention to details can cut in half the size unit you need and pare operating expense proportionately . A well-designed , 1200-square-foot house can be comfortably cooled and heated for as little as $128 a year , or $11 a month . If you have a house which heat doesn't penetrate easily , your unit will have less heat to remove . Keep the direct sun from reaching the house and you've won the first battle . In a new house , generous roof overhangs are a logical and effective solution . If the house you plan to buy or build won't have big overhangs , you can still do a fair job of keeping the sun off walls and windows with properly designed trellises , fences and awnings . Shade trees , too , are a big help , so keep them if you can . Drawn blinds and draperies do some good , but not nearly as much as shading devices on the outside of the house . The more directly the sun strikes walls and roof , the greater its heat impact . The way a house is set on its lot can therefore influence how much cooling you're going to need . A shift in the walls , or a change in the roof slope , so the sun hits them more obliquely , can save you money . You can use heat-absorbing glass to stop the sun , double glass and insulated glass to combat condensation . Restrict large glass areas to the north and south sides of the house . They're easier to shade there . An attic space above insulation makes a house easier to cool . You'll even gain by putting your water heater outside the conditioned space , and using an electric range instead of a gas one . Gas adds to the moisture load . Insulate , weatherstrip , double-glaze to the maximum . In insulation , the numbers to remember are 6-4-2 . They stand for 6 inches of mineral wool insulation in the ceiling , 4 inches in the side walls , 2 inches in the floors . Such extra-thick insulation not only permits a much smaller cooling installation , but will continue to reduce operating expenses both in heating and cooling . A light-colored roof will reduce sun heat by 50 per cent . It costs two to three times as much to remove a BTU in summer as it does to add one in winter , so every solitary BTU is worth attention . You'll foil them in droves , along with their pal humidity , by having and using a kitchen range exhaust fan , a bathroom ventilator for when you shower , and an outside vent for the clothes drier . Keeping conditioners quiet . It's no use pretending that all conditioners are quiet , but the noise they produce can be kept to a minimum . Good workmanship is important in the installation , so if you're doing your own contracting , don't award the job on the basis of price alone . Avoid attic placement directly above a bedroom . Most recreation work calls for a good deal of pre-planning . This is particularly true in site selection . You must know before you start what the needs and objectives of your organization are ; ; you must have a list of requirements on where , how many , and what type sites are needed . With such a program you can make constructive selections of the best sites available . Begin the examination of a site with a good map and aerial photos if possible . These are becoming more and more available through the work of counties and other government agencies . The new editions of topographic maps being made by the federal government are excellent for orienting yourself to the natural features of the site . These are inexpensive and available from the U. S. Geological Society , Washington 25 , D. C. . In recent years many counties and the U. S. Forest Service have taken aerial photos which show features in detail and are very good for planning use . Most counties also have maps available from the county engineer showing roads and other features and from the assessor's office showing ownerships of land . Inspect the site in the field during the time of the year when the area will be most heavily used for recreation . This gives you a better opportunity to get the feel of the climate conditions , the exposure to the sun and wind , the water interests , etcetera , which vary greatly with the seasons . It is usually helpful to make a sketch map in the field , showing the size and location of the features of interest and to take photographs at the site . These are a great aid for planning use back at the office . For site planning work , it is best to have a qualified and experienced park planner to carry through the study . However , there is also much to be gained by making use of the abilities of the local people who are available and interested in recreation . County judges , commissioners , engineers , assessors , and others who have lived in the area for a long time may have valuable knowledge regarding the site or opinions to offer from their varied professional experiences . A visit to the site by a group of several persons can usually bring out new ideas or verify opinions most helpful to the planning study of any recreation area . How much study is required ? This , of course , depends on the character of the site itself , the previous experience of the investigator , and the number of factors needed to arrive at a good decision . It is too easy for the inexperienced person to make a quick judgment of a few values of the area and base a decision on these alone . Usually there are more factors to good site planning than first impressions . A site may be a rundown slum or a desolate piece of desert in appearance today but have excellent potentials for the future with a little development or water . The same is true of areas which at first look good because of a few existing recreation features but may actually be poor areas to develop for general public use . In looking for the best sites available that meet the requirements , you need information to compare the site with others . You need answers to four important questions . What are the existing recreation features ? How well can the site be developed ? How useful will it be to the public ? Is this site available ? Check the quantity and quality of all of the recreation interests already existing at the site . Naturally , a park site with scenic views , a good lake , trees , and sand dunes , will attract more people than a nearby area with only trees and dunes . Quality is vitally important . Frontage on a body of clear , clean water will be vastly different from the same amount of frontage on polluted water . Some recreation features , such as scenic values and water interest , also have greater overall value than other interests . One of the most desirable features for a park are beautiful views or scenery . It may be distant views of a valley or the mountains or natural features such as a small lake , colorful rock formations , or unusual trees . A site which overlooks a harbor or river may offer interest in the activities of boating traffic . An area on the coast may have relaxing views of the surf rolling in on a beach . A site may also be attractive just through the beauty of its trees and shrubs . Note extent of these interests and how available they will be for the public to enjoy . Water interest is one of the most valuable factors you can find for a recreation site . Most park planners look to water frontage for basic park areas . This follows naturally since frontage on an ocean , stream , or lake provides scenic values and opportunities for the very popular recreation activities of bathing , fishing , boating , and other water sports . A body of water is usually the center of interest at parks which attract the greatest picnic and camping use . It also cools the air in summer and nourishes the trees and wild life . The amount of water frontage , the quantity and quality of the water , and the recreation afforded by it are important . A restricted frontage may be too crowded an area for public use . The quantity of water flow may be critical ; ; a stream or pond which is attractive in the springtime may become stagnant or dry in late summer . If the site is on a reservoir , the level of the water at various seasons as it affects recreation should be studied . Check the quality of the water . A stream which has all of its watershed within a national forest or other lands under good conservation practices is less likely to be affected by pollution than one passing through unrestricted logging or past an industrial area . Other factors , such as water temperature , depth of water , the fish life it supports , wave action , flooding , etcetera , will affect its recreation value . Other natural features which can be of high interest are the forests , canyons , mountains , deserts , seacoast , beaches , sand dunes , waterfalls , springs , etcetera with which the area is blessed . Just as the national and state parks place emphasis on features which are of national or state significance , counties should seek out these features which are distinctive of their area . Although the site may not contain the features themselves , there are often opportunities to include them as additional interest to the site . The route to the park may lead people past them or display views of them . A group of native trees or plants which are outstanding in a particular county can be featured at the site . The fish , animals , and birds which may be found at the site are another interest . Fishing interest calls for a check of the species found , quantity and size , the season they are available , and the stocking program of the fish commission . Animals may be present at the site or provide hunting in nearby areas . The site may be on one of the major flyways of migratory birds or have its own resident bird life . Clams , crabs , and other marine life may add interest at coastal areas . Each area has its own historical interests with which much can be done . Park visitors are always eager to learn more about the area they are in . The historical sign tells its story , but nothing gets interest across as well as some of the original historical items or places themselves which still have the character of the period covered . Notice should be taken of unusual rock formations , deposits , or shapes of the earth's crust in your region . Those which tell a story of the earth's formation in each area can add geological interest to the recreation sites . An old shipwreck , a high dam , an old covered bridge , a place to find agates or other semi-precious stones or a place to pan gold , etcetera may be of interest . Some areas may provide archeological values such as ancient Indian village sites or hunting areas , caves , artifacts , etcetera . How well can the site be developed ? Look at the physical features of the land to determine how desirable it is for use , what can be done to correct the faults , and what it will cost to make the area meet your needs in comparison to other sites . Many things need to be checked : size and shape -- The size of the area alone can be a determining factor . An area may be too small for the needs of the project . Areas should be large enough to include the attractions , have ample space for the use of facilities needed , and have room around the edges to protect the values of the area from encroachment by private developments . Acreage in excess of the minimum is good practice as recreation areas are never too large for the future and it is often more economical to operate one large area than several small ones . Shape of the area is also related to the use attractions and needs of the development . A large picnic area or camping development is most efficient in shape as a square or rectangle several hundred feet in width in preference to a long narrow area less than one hundred feet wide . This is true because of savings in utility lines and the fact that your buildings have a useful radius equal in all directions . However , a narrow strip may be very practical for small developments , or to provide additional stream frontage for a fisherman's trail , or include scenic strips within the park unit . Adjoining areas -- The values of the site may be affected by the appearance of the adjoining lands , ownership and use of the land , and the utilities available there . For instance , a site adjoining other publicly owned lands , such as a national forest or a public road , may be desirable , whereas a site next to an industrial plant might not . The utilities available nearby may provide a savings in the cost of extending electricity or water to the site . Topography -- Topography is very important . Check the elevation of the ground , degree and direction of slopes , drainage , rock outcrops , topsoil types and quality , as well as subsoil . Nearly level areas are required for parking areas , beaches , camp areas , ballfields , etcetera . Determine how much topography limits useful area or what the costs of earth moving or grading might be . Water -- In addition to its recreation interests , water is needed for drinking , sanitation , and irrigation . The quantity and quality of water sources is often a big factor in site selection . The area may provide good springs or opportunities for a well or be near to municipal water lines . Figure the cost of providing water to the use areas . Plants -- The existing plant growth calls for thorough checking . Look at the trees as to size and interest , the amount of shade they provide , how healthy they are , the problems of maintenance , fire hazards , wind throw , etcetera . An area may have been partially logged and requires removal of stumps or clean-up . Some shrubs may be of good landscaping value , other areas of brush may need to be cleared . The extent and location of open areas is noted . Exposure -- How much will wind , rain , sun , and temperature affect the use ? An area sheltered from strong winds may be highly desirable for recreation use . The direction , velocity , and season of these winds should be noted as to just how they will affect the recreation use and your maintenance and operation of the area . Lack of rainfall and extreme temperatures may call for the development of shade and irrigation of a site to make it useable . Sometimes , you have a choice of exposure for sites where the topography or trees of the area will provide afternoon shade , morning sun , or whatever may be most desirable for the use intended . Improvements -- Some areas may already have been improved and contain buildings , roads , utilities , cleared land , etcetera which may raise the cost of the site . Your invitation to write about Serge Prokofieff to honor his 70th Anniversary for the April issue of Sovietskaya Muzyka is accepted with pleasure , because I admire the music of Prokofieff ; ; and with sober purpose , because the development of Prokofieff personifies , in many ways , the course of music in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics . The Serge Prokofieff whom we knew in the United States of America was gay , witty , mercurial , full of pranks and bonheur -- and very capable as a professional musician . These qualities endeared him to both the musicians and the social-economic haute monde which supported the concert world of the post-World War 1 , era . Prokofieff's outlook as a composer-pianist-conductor in America was , indeed , brilliant . Prokofieff's Classical Symphony was hailed as an ingenious work from a naturally gifted and well-trained musician still in his twenties . To the Traditionalists , it was a brilliant satire on modernism ; ; to the Neo-Classicists , it was a challenge to the pre-war world . What was it to Prokofieff ? A tongue-in-cheek stylization of 18th-Century ideas ; ; a trial balloon to test the aesthetic climate of the times ; ; a brilliant piece de resistance ? Certainly its composer was an ascending star on a new world horizon . I heard the Classical Symphony for the first time when Koussevitzky conducted it in Paris in 1927 . All musical Paris was there . Some musicians were enthusiastic , some skeptical . I myself was one of the skeptics ( 35 years ago ) . I remember Ernest Bloch in the foyer , shouting in his high-pitched voice : `` it may be a tour de force , mais mon Dieu , can anyone take this music seriously '' ? The answer is , `` Yes '' ! Certainly , America took Prokofieff and his Classical Symphony seriously , and with a good deal of pleasure . His life-long friend , Serge Koussevitzky , gave unreservedly of his praise and brilliant performances in Boston , New York , and Washington , D.C. , , to which he added broadcastings and recordings for the whole nation . Chicago was also a welcome host : there , in 1921 , Prokofieff conducted the world premiere of the Love For Three Oranges , and played the first performance of his Third Piano Concerto . `` Uncle Sam '' was , indeed , a rich uncle to Prokofieff , in those opulent , post-war victory years of peace and prosperity , bold speculations and extravaganzas , enjoyment and pleasure : `` The Golden Twenties '' . We attended the premieres of his concertos , symphonies , and suites ; ; we studied , taught , and performed his piano sonatas , chamber music , gavottes , and marches ; ; we bought his records and played them in our schools and universities . We unanimously agreed that Prokofieff had won his rights as a world citizen to the first ranks of Twentieth-Century Composers . Nevertheless , Prokofieff was much influenced by Paris during the Twenties : the Paris which was the artistic center of the Western World -- the social Paris to which Russian aristocracy migrated -- the chic Paris which attracted the tourist dollars of rich America -- the avant-garde Paris of Diaghileff , Stravinsky , Koussevitzky , Cocteau , Picasso -- the laissez-faire Paris of Dadaism and ultramodern art -- the Paris sympathique which took young composers to her bosom with such quick and easy enthusiasms . So young Prokofieff was the darling of success : in his motherland ; ; in the spacious hunting grounds of `` Uncle Sam '' ; ; in the exciting salons of his lovely , brilliant Paris -- mistress of gaiety -- excess and abandon -- world theatre of new-found freedoms in tone , color , dance , design , and thought . Meanwhile , three great terrible forces were coagulating and crystallizing . In this world-wide conscription of men , minds , and machines , Prokofieff was recalled to his native land . The world exploded when Fascism challenged all concepts of peace and liberty , and the outraged , freedom-loving peoples of the Capitalist and Socialist worlds combined forces to stamp Fascist tyranny into cringing submission . After this holocaust , a changing world occupied the minds of men ; ; a world beset with new boundaries , new treaties and governments , new goals and methods , and the age-old fears of aggression and subjugation -- hunger and exposure . In this changed world , Prokofieff settled to find himself , and to create for large national purpose . Here , this happy , roving son of good fortune proved that he could accept the disciplines of a new social-economic order fighting for its very existence and ideals in a truculent world . Here , Prokofieff became a workman in the vineyards of Socialism -- producing music for the masses . It is at this point in his life that the mature Prokofieff emerges . One might have expected that such a violent epoch of transition would have destroyed the creative flair of a composer , especially one whose works were so fluent and spontaneous . But no : Prokofieff grew . He accepted the environment of his destiny -- took root and grew to fulfill the stature of his early promise . By 1937 he had clarified his intentions to serve his people : `` I have striven for clarity and melodious idiom , but at the same time I have by no means attempted to restrict myself to the accepted methods of harmony and melody . This is precisely what makes lucid , straightforward music so difficult to compose -- the clarity must be new , not old '' . How right he was ; ; how clearly he saw the cultural defection of experimentation as an escape for those who dare not or prefer not to face the discipline of modern traditionalism . And with what resource did Prokofieff back up his Credo of words -- with torrents of powerful music . Compare the vast difference in scope and beauty between his neat and witty little Classical Symphony and his big , muscular , passionate , and eloquent Fifth Symphony ; ; or the Love For Three Oranges ( gay as it is ) with the wonderful , imaginative , colorful , and subtle tenderness of the magnificent ballet , The Stone Flower . This masterpiece has gaiety , too , but it is the gaiety of dancing people : earthy , salty and humorous . Of course , these works are not comparable , even though the same brain conceived them . The early works were conceived for a sophisticated , international audience ; ; the later works were conceived to affirm a way of life for fellow citizens . However , in all of Prokofieff's music , young or mature , we find his profile -- his `` signature '' -- his craftsman's attitude . Prokofieff never forsakes his medium for the cause of experimentation per se . In orchestration , he stretches the limits of instrumentation with good judgment and a fine imagination for color . His sense for rhythmic variety and timing is impeccable . His creative development of melodic designs of Slavic dance tunes and love songs is captivating : witty , clever , adroit , and subtle . His counterpoint is pertinent , skillful , and rarely thick . Also , it should be noted that the polytonal freedom of his melodies and harmonic modulations , the brilliant orchestrations , the adroitness for evading the heaviness of figured bass , the skill in florid counterpoint were not lost in his mature output , even in the spectacular historical dramas of the stage and cinema , where a large , dramatic canvas of sound was required . That Prokofieff's harmonies and forms sometimes seem professionally routine to our ears , may or may not indicate that he was less of an `` original '' than we prefer to believe . Need for novelty may be a symptom of cultural fatigue and instability . Prokofieff might well emerge as a cultural hero , who , by the force of his creative life , helped preserve the main stream of tradition , to which the surviving idioms of current experimentalism may be eventually added and integrated . At this date , it seems probable that the name of Serge Prokofieff will appear in the archives of History , as an effective Traditionalist , who was fully aware of the lure and danger of experimentation , and used it as it served his purpose ; ; yet was never caught up in it -- never a slave to its academic dialectics . Certainly , it is the traditional clarity of his music which has endeared him to the Western World -- not his experimentations . So Prokofieff was able to cultivate his musical talents and harvest a rich reward from them . Nor can anyone be certain that Prokofieff would have done better , or even as well , under different circumstances . His fellow-countryman , Igor Stravinsky , certainly did not . Why did Prokofieff expand in stature and fecundity , while Stravinsky ( who leaped into fame like a young giant ) dwindled in stature and fruitfulness ? I think the answer is to be found in Prokofieff's own words : `` the clarity must be new , not old '' . When Prokofieff forged his new clarity of `` lucid , straightforward music , so difficult to compose '' , he shaped his talents to his purpose . When Stravinsky shaped his purpose to the shifting scenes of many cultures , many salons , many dialectics , many personalities , he tried to refashion himself into a stylist of many styles , determined by many disparate cultures . Prokofieff was guided in a consistent direction by the life of his own people -- by the compass of their national ideas . But Stravinsky was swayed by the attitudes of whatever culture he was reflecting . In all his miscalculations , Stravinsky made the fatal historical blunder of presuming that he could transform other composers' inspirations -- representing many peoples , time periods and styles -- into his own music by warping the harmony , melody , or form , to verify his own experiments . Because of the authentic homogeneity of his early Nationalistic materials , and his flair for orchestrations -- his brilliant Petruchka , his savage Sacre Du Printemps , his incisive Les Noces -- the world kept hoping that he could recapture the historical direction for which his native talents were predisposed . But time is running out , and many of Stravinsky's admirers begin to fear that he will never find terra firma . His various aesthetic postulates remain as landmarks of a house divided against itself : Supra-Expressionism , Neo-Paganism , Neo-Classicism , Neo-Romanticism , Neo-Jazz , Neo-Ecclesiasticism , Neo-Popularism , and most recently , Post-Serialism -- all competing with each other within one composer ! What a patchwork of proclamations and renunciations ! Meager and shabby by-products linger to haunt our memories of a once mighty protagonist ; ; a maladroit reharmonization of our National Anthem ( The Star-Spangled Banner ) ; ; a poor attempt to write an idiomatic jazz concerto ; ; a circus polka for elephants ; ; his hopes that the tunes from his old music might be used for popular American commercial songs ! Stravinsky , nearing the age of eighty , is like a lost and frantic bird , flitting from one abandoned nest to another , searching for a home . How differently Prokofieff's life unfolded . Prokofieff was able to adjust his creative personality to a swiftly changing world without losing his particular force and direction . In the process , his native endowments were stretched , strengthened and disciplined to serve their human purpose . With a large and circumspect 20th-Century technique , he wove the materials of national heroes and events , national folklore and children's fairy tales -- Slavic dances and love songs -- into a solid musical literature which served his people well , and is providing much enjoyment to the World at large . Of course , it must not be forgotten that in achieving this historical feat , Prokofieff had the vast resources of his people behind him ; ; time and economic security ; ; symphony orchestras , opera and ballet companies ; ; choruses , chamber music ensembles ; ; soloists ; ; recordings ; ; broadcastings ; ; television ; ; large and eager audiences . It must be conceded that his native land provided Prokofieff with many of the necessary conditions for great creative incentive : economic security and cultural opportunities , incisive idioms , social fermentations for a new national ideology -- a sympathetic public and a large body of performers especially trained to fulfill his purpose . Thus in Prokofieff the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics produced one of the great composers of the Twentieth Century . That his moods , even in his early years , are those of his people , does him honor , as his music honors those who inspired it . That he mastered every aspect of his medium according to his own great talents and contemporary judgments , is a good and solid symbol of his people under the tremendous pressures of proclaiming and practising the rigors of a new culture ; ; and perhaps of even greater significance -- his music is strong 20th-Century evidence of the effectiveness of Evolution , based on a broad Traditionalism for the creative art of music . April 10 marked a memorable date in New York's musical history -- indeed in the musical history of the entire eastern United States . On that date the Musicians Emergency Fund , organized to furnish employment for musicians unable to obtain engagements during the depression and to provide relief for older musicians who lost their fortunes in the stock market crash , observed its 30th anniversary . Roy Mason is essentially a landscape painter whose style and direction has a kinship with the English watercolorists of the early nineteenth century , especially the beautifully patterned art of John Sell Cotman . And like this English master , Mason realizes his subjects in large , simplified masses which , though they seem effortless , are in reality the result of skilled design born of hard work and a thorough distillation of the natural form that inspired them . As a boy Roy Mason began the long process of extracting the goodness of the out-of-doors , its tang of weather , its change of seasons , its variable moods . His father , a professional engraver and an amateur landscape painter , took his sons on numerous hunting expeditions , and imparted to them his knowledge and love of nature . Out of this background of hunting and fishing , it was only natural that Roy first painted subjects he knew best : hunters in the field , fishermen in the stream , ducks and geese on the wing -- almost always against a vast backdrop of weather landscape . It is this subject matter that has brought Mason a large and enthusiastic following among sportsmen , but it is his exceptional performance with this motif that commends him to artists and discerning collectors . Mason had to earn the privilege of devoting himself exclusively to painting . Like many others , he had to work hard , long hours in a struggling family business which , though it was allied to art of a kind -- the design and production of engraved seals -- bore no relation to the painting of pictures . But it did teach Roy the basic techniques of commercial art , and later , for twelve years , he and his sister Nina conducted an advertising art studio in Philadelphia . On the death of their father , they returned to their home in Batavia , New York . After more years of concentrated effort , Roy and his brother Max finally established a thriving family business at the old stand . During all this time Roy continued to paint , first only on weekends , and then , as the family business permitted , for longer periods . Gradually he withdrew from the shop altogether , and for the past thirty years , he has worked independently as a painter , except for his continued hunting and fishing expeditions . But even on these , the palette often takes over while the shotgun cools off ! Except for a rich friendship with the painter , Chauncey Ryder who gave him the only professional instruction he ever had -- and this was limited to a few lessons , though the two artists often went on painting trips together -- Roy developed his art by himself . In the best tradition , he first taught himself to see , then to draw with accuracy and assurance , and then to paint . He worked in oil for years before beginning his work in watercolor , and his first public recognition and early honors , including his election to the Academy , were for his essays in the heavier medium . Gradually watercolor claimed his greater affection until today it has become his major , if not exclusive , technique . It has been my privilege to paint with Roy Mason on numerous occasions , mostly in the vicinity of Batavia . More often than not I have found easy excuse to leave my own work and stand at a respectable distance where I could watch this man transform raw nature into a composed , not imitative , painting . What I have observed time and time again is a process of integration , integration that begins as abstract design and gradually takes on recognizable form ; ; color patterns that are made to weave throughout the whole composition ; ; and that over-all , amazing control of large washes which is the Mason stylemark . Finally come those little flicks of a rigger brush and the job is done . Inspiring -- yes ; ; instructive -- maybe ; ; duplicable -- no ! But for the technical fact , we have the artist's own testimony : `` Of late years , I find that I like best to work out-of-doors . First I make preliminary watercolor sketches in quarter scale ( approximately Af inches ) in which I pay particular attention to the design principles of three simple values -- the lightest light , the middle tone , and the darkest dark -- by reducing the forms of my subject to these large patterns . If a human figure or wild life are to be part of the projected final picture , I try to place them in the initial sketch . For me , these will belong more completely to their surroundings if they are conceived in this early stage , though I freely admit that I do not hesitate to add or eliminate figures on the full sheet when it serves my final purpose . `` I am thoroughly convinced that most watercolors suffer because the artist expects nature will do his composing for him ; ; as a result , such pictures are only a literal translation of what the artist finds in the scene before him . Just because a tree or other object appears in a certain spot is absolutely no reason to place it in the same position in the painting , unless the position serves the design of the whole composition . If the artist would study his work more thoroughly and move certain units in his design , often only slightly , finer pictures would result . Out of long experience I have found that incidental figures and other objects like trees , logs , and bushes can be traced from the original sketch and moved about in the major areas on the final sheet until they occupy the right position , which I call clicking . `` Speed in painting a picture is valid only when it imparts spontaneity and crispness , but unless the artist has lots of experience so that he can control rapid execution , he would do well to take these first sketches and soberly reorder their design to achieve a unified composition . `` If I have seemed to emphasize the structure of the composition , I mean to project equal concern for color . Often , in working out-of-doors under all conditions of light and atmosphere , a particular passage that looked favorable in relation to the subject will be too bright , too dull , or too light , or too dark when viewed indoors in a mat . When this occurs , I make the change on the sketch or on the final watercolor -- if I have been working on a full sheet in the field . `` When working from one of my sketches I square it up and project its linear form freehand to the watercolor sheet with charcoal . When this linear draft is completed , I dust it down to a faint image . From this point , I paint in as direct a manner as possible , by flowing on the washes with as pure a color mixture as I can manage . However , first I thoughtfully study my sketch for improvement of color and design along the lines I have described . Then I plan my attack : the parts I will finish first , the range of values , the accenting of minor details -- all in all , mechanics of producing the finished job with a maximum of crispness . The longer I work , the more I am sure that for me , at least , a workmanlike method is important . Trial and error are better placed in the preliminary sketch than in hoping for miracles in the final painting . `` As for materials , I use the best available . I work on a watercolor easel in the field , and frequently resort to a large garden umbrella to protect my eyes from undue strain . In my studio I work at a tilt-top table , but leave the paper unfixed so that I can move it freely to control the washes . I have used a variety of heavy-weight hand-made papers , but prefer an English make , rough surface , in 400-pound weight . After selecting a sheet and inspecting it for flaws ( even the best sometimes has foreign ' nubbins ' on its surface ) , I sponge it thoroughly on both sides with clean , cold water . Then I dry the sheet under mild pressure so that it will lie flat as a board . `` In addition to the usual tools , I make constant use of cleansing tissue , not only to wipe my brushes , but to mop up certain areas , to soften edges , and to open up lights in dark washes . The great absorbency of this tissue and the fact that it is easier to control than a sponge makes it an ideal tool for the watercolorist . I also use a small electric hand-blower to dry large washes in the studio . `` My brushes are different from those used by most watercolorists , for I combine the sable and the bristle . The red sables are 8 ; ; two riggers , 6 and 10 ; ; and a very large , flat wash brush . The bristles are a Fitch 2 and a one-half inch brush shaved to a sharp chisel edge . `` My usual palette consists of top-quality colors : alizarin crimson , orange , raw sienna , raw umber , burnt sienna , sepia , cerulean blue , cobalt blue , French ultramarine blue , Winsor green , Hooker's green 2 , cadmium yellow pale , yellow ochre , Payne's gray , charcoal gray , Davy's gray , and ivory black '' . In analyzing the watercolors of Roy Mason , the first thing that comes to mind is their essential decorativeness , yet this word has such a varied connotation that it needs some elaboration here . True , a Mason watercolor is unmistakably a synthesis of nature rather than a detailed inventory . Unlike many decorative patterns that present a static flat convention , this artist's pictures are full of atmosphere and climate . Long observation has taught Mason that most landscape can be reduced to three essential planes : a foreground in sharp focus -- either a light area with dark accents or a dark one with lights ; ; a middle distance often containing the major motif ; ; and a background , usually a silhouetted form foiled against the sky . In following this general principle , Mason provides the observer with a natural eye progression from foreground to background , and the illusion of depth is instantly created . When painting , Mason's physical eyes are half-closed , while his mind's eye is wide open , and this circumstance accounts in part for the impression he wishes to convey . He does not insist on telling all he knows about any given subject ; ; rather his pictures invite the observer to draw on his memory , his imagination , his nostalgia . It is for this reason that Roy avoids selecting subjects that require specific recognition of place for their enjoyment . His pictures generalize , though they are inspired by a particular locale ; ; they universalize in terms of weather , skies , earth , and people . By dealing with common landscape in an uncommon way , Roy Mason has found a particular niche in American landscape art . Living with his watercolors is a vicarious experience of seeing nature distilled through the eyes of a sensitive interpretor , a breath and breadth of the outdoor world to help man honor the Creator of it all . The artist was born in Gilbert Mills , New York , in 1886 , and until two years ago when he and his wife moved to California , he lived in western New York , in Batavia . When I looked up the actual date of his birth and found it to be March 15th , I realized that Roy was born under the right zodiacal sign for a watercolorist : the water sign of Pisces ( February 18 thru March 20 ) . And how very often a water plane is featured in his landscapes , and how appropriate that he should appear in American Artist again , in his natal month of March ! Over the years , beginning in 1929 , Mason has been awarded seventeen major prizes including two gold medals ; ; two Ranger Fund purchase awards ; ; the Joseph Pennell Memorial Medal ; ; two American Watercolor Society prizes ; ; the Blair Purchase Prize for watercolor , Art Institute of Chicago ; ; and others in Buffalo , New York , Chautauqua , New Haven , Rochester , Rockport , and most recently , the $300 prize for a watercolor at the Laguna Beach Art Association , He was elected to the National Academy of Design as an Associate in the oil class in 1931 ( after receiving his first Ranger Fund Purchase Prize at the Academy in 1930 ) , and elevated to Academicianship in 1940 . Other memberships include the American Watercolor Society , Philadelphia Water Color Club , Allied Artists of America , Audubon Artists , Baltimore Watercolor Society . The Russian gymnasts beat the tar out of the American gymnasts in the 1960 Olympics for one reason -- they were better . They were better trained , better looking , better built , better disciplined and something else -- they were better dancers . Our athletes are only just beginning to learn that they must study dance . The Russians are all trained as dancers before they start to study gymnastics . But why gymnastics at all ? And is the sport really important ? After all , we did pretty well in some other areas of the Olympics competition . But if it is important , what can we do to improve ourselves ? It is more than just lack of dance training that is our problem , for just as gymnastics can learn from dance , dance has some very important things to learn from gymnastics . Taking first things first , let's understand the sport called gymnastics . It is made up of tumbling , which might be said to start with a somersault , run through such stunts as headstands , handstands , cartwheels , backbends , and culminate in nearly impossible combinations of aerial flips and twists and apparatus work . The apparatus used by gymnasts was once a common sight in American gyms , but about 1930 it was dropped in favor of games . The parallel bars , horse , buck , springboard , horizontal bar , rings , and mats formerly in the school gyms were replaced by baseball , volleyball , basketball and football . But the Russians use gymnastics as the first step in training for all other sports because it provides training in every basic quality except one , endurance . The gymnast must develop strength , flexibility , coordination , timing , rhythm , courage , discipline , persistence and the desire for perfection . In short , gymnastics uses every part of the body and requires a great deal of character as well . The addition of endurance training later , when the body is mature enough to benefit from it without danger of injury , provides that final quality that makes the top athlete , soldier or citizen . Another reason gymnastic study is valuable is that it can be started very early in life . ( An enterprising teacher or parent could start training a healthy child at the age of seven days . Most Europeans have been exercising newborn infants for centuries . ) In most sports , as in most walks of life , the angels are on the side of those who begin young , and the Russian competitor of 16 has at least thirteen years of training behind him . The American is very lucky if he has three . If a nation wished to get a head start in physical fitness over all other nations , it would start its kindergarten students on a program of gymnastics the day they entered and thus eliminate a large number of the problems that plague American schools . First of the problems attacked would be fatigue and emotional tension , since action relieves both . Oddly enough , it is proven that there would be less reading difficulty . Certainly there would be less anxiety , fewer accidents ( it is the clumsy child who sustains the worst injuries ) , and higher scholastic averages , since alert children work better . Russia knows this , and that is why there were over 800,000 competing for places as candidates for the Olympic gymnastic team . Eighty thousand won top honors and a chance to try for the team itself . We could scarcely find eighty in our great land of over 180 million people . And what has dancing to do with all this ? A great deal . Russia's young gymnasts have studied dance before having the rigorous training on apparatus . Well-stretched , trained in posture and coordinated movement , and wedded to rhythm , they presented the audiences in Rome with one of the most beautiful sights ever seen at any Olympic contest . American audiences in particular learned two valuable lessons . They saw completely masculine and obviously virile men performing with incredible grace . They were further stripped of old wive's tales by seeing the slender , lovely Russian girls performing feats requiring tremendous strength and with not one bulging muscle . President Kennedy has asked that we become a physically fit nation . If we wait until children are in junior high or high school , we will never manage it . To be fit , one has to start early with young children , and today the only person who really reaches such children is the teacher of dance . If the dance teachers of America make it their business to prepare their young charges for the gymnastics that must come some day if our schools are really responsible , we will be that much ahead . School teachers , all too unprepared for the job they must do , will need demonstrators . There should be youngsters who know how to do a headstand , and also how to help other children learn it . They should know simple exercises that could prepare less fortunate children for the sports we will demand be taught . Dance teachers can respond to President Kennedy's request not only through their regular dance work , but also through the kind of basic gymnastic work that makes for strength and flexibility . Very little in today's living provides the strength we need and nothing provides the flexibility . Dancers do have flexibility . They often fail , however , to develop real abdominal , back , chest , shoulder and arm strength . Ask any group of ballerinas to do ten push-ups or three chin-ups and the results , considering the amount of physical training they have had , will be very disappointing . Even the boys will not be outstanding in these areas . This isn't surprising when we consider that over 29 percent of the 11-year-old boys in America cannot chin themselves once , and that English school girls outdo them in almost every test ( even dashes and endurance ) . The only area in which American boys hold their own is the baseball throw . The chinning bar For arm and shoulder strength a chinning bar is recommended . It should be installed over a door that is in full view of everyone , and a chair should be placed under it , a little to one side . Those children who can chin themselves should be told to do one chin-up each time they pass under it . Those who are too weak , should climb on the chair and , starting at the top of the chin , let themselves slowly down . When they can take ten seconds to accomplish the descent , they will have the strength to chin-up . Parents should be informed about this system and encouraged to do the same with the whole family at home . The horse kick Arm , shoulder , chest , upper and lower back strength will be aided with the Horse kick . Start on hands and feet . Keeping the hands in the starting position , run in place to a quick rhythm . After this has become easy , use slower and slower rhythms , kicking higher and higher . Follow this by crossing from one corner of the room to the other on all fours , kicking as high as possible . Push-ups Push-ups are essential , but few have the strength for them at first . Start on the knees in a large circle . Fall slowly forward onto the hands and let the body down to rest on the floor . Push back up and repeat . Do this exercise six times each class period . As strength improves start in a standing position with legs wide apart and upper body bent forward . Start by falling forward to a point close to the feet , and , as strength improves , fall farther and farther out . Try to push back to the stand position from the stretched position without any intermediate pushes from the hands . The push-up itself can be taught by starting at the top of the push-up with legs spread wide . Let the body down slowly , taking at least five seconds for the letting down . Five of these done daily for about a week will develop the strength for one push-up . Handstands Handstands come after arms , chest and shoulders have developed at least a minimum of strength . Of course those who have developed more will find them easier . Start with the class standing in a circle , with weight on the right foot and the left extended a little way into the circle . At first each child should do a kick-up by himself so that the teacher can determine those ready to work alone , and those who need help . Drop both hands to the floor and at the same time kick the right foot up in back . The left will follow at once . The right will land first , followed by the left . Return to the standing position . Care should be taken to see that the hands are placed on the floor before the kick starts and also that the landing foot is brought as close to the hands as possible . This will prevent flat falls and toe injuries . Bare feet are better for such work than any form of slipper . Eventually the class will be able to kick up high enough so that the teacher can catch the leading leg . The child should then bring both legs together overhead , point the toes and tighten the seat muscles . Be sure that the landing foot is brought close to the hands and that only one foot lands at a time . Backbends The backbend is of extreme importance to any form of free gymnastics , and , as with all acrobatics , the sooner begun the better the results . Have the class lie supine with knees apart and bent . Place flat palms on either side of the head a few inches away from the ears , fingers pointing toward the shoulders . Arch the back upwards to make a bridge . Be sure the head drops backward so that the child looks at the floor rather than toward the ceiling . As flexibility improves , the feet will move closer to the hands and the bridge rise higher . Later this can be combined with the handstand to provide a walkover . Back circle To further increase back flexibility , work on the back circle . Have the class lie prone . Place the hands in front of the chest . Keep the legs straight and the toes pointed . Straighten the arms slowly , this arches the back . At the peak of the arch , tip the head back and bend the knees in an effort to touch toes to head . Improvement can be measured by the lessening distance between toes and head . Somersaults The last essential to the beginner's gymnastic program is the somersault , or forward roll . This used to be part of every child's bag of tricks , but few children can do it today ; ; some are actually incapable of rolling forward and are completely confused when not sitting or standing upright . For most small children , learning a forward roll is simply a matter of copying another child who can . After it has been seen , have the child start on a mat on hands and knees ( a thin , inexpensive mat is quite sufficient for anything that does not require falling ) . He places the hands on either side of the head , keeping the chin down on the chest . He then pushes his seat into the air and the teacher guides it over . One or two practice runs should be sufficient for solo . If , however , the child is weak , overweight , or afraid , more help will be needed . When the child raises his seat into the air , the teacher takes hold under both sides of the pelvis ; ; then no matter what happens , the child's performance will be controlled . By lifting the seat upwards a little , the weight is taken off the neck and the back is kept rounded . These are beginnings , but correctly learned they prepare for satisfying and exciting stunts that can be performed by a strong , flexible body ( we are not talking of eccentric extremes ) . Even if gymnastics are not the ultimate goal , the good tumbler will be a better dancer , a better athlete , and a human being with a greater margin of safety in any activity . It is very important for parents to understand that early training is imperative . And dancing school , so helpful in artistic and psychological development , also contributes to this essential early training -- and can contribute even more . Every taxpayer is well aware of the vast size of our annual defense budget and most of our readers also realize that a large portion of these expenditures go for military electronics . We have noted how some electronic techniques , developed for the defense effort , have evenutally been used in commerce and industry . The host of novel applications of electronics to medical problems is far more thrilling because of their implication in matters concerning our health and vitality . When we consider the electronic industry potential for human betterment , the prospect is staggering . The author has recently studied the field of medical electronics and has been convinced that , in this area alone , the application of electronic equipment has enormous possibilities . The benefits electronics can bring to bio-medicine may be greater by far than any previous medical discovery . We use the term `` bio-medicine '' because of the close interrelation between biology and medical research . Electronics has been applied to medicine for many years in the form of such familiar equipment as the x-ray machine , the electrocardiograph , and the diathermy machine . Recently many doctors have installed ultrasonic vibration machines for deep massage of bruises , contusions , and simple bursitis . Commonly used electronic devices which are found in practically every hospital are closed-circuit TV and audio systems for internal paging and instruction , along with radiation counters , timers , and similar devices . In this article we will concentrate on the advances in the application of electronics in bio-medical research laboratories because this is where tomorrow's commonplace equipment originates . From the wealth of material and the wide variety of different electronic techniques perfected in the past few years we have selected a few examples which appear to be headed for use in the immediate future and which offer completely new tools in medical research . Ultraviolet microscopy Many cells , bacteria , and other microorganisms are transparent to visible light and must be stained for microscopic investigation . This stain often disrupts the normal cell activity or else colors only the outside . A completely new insight into living cells and their structure will be possible by use of a new technique which replaces visible light with ultraviolet radiation and combines a microscope with a color-TV system to view the results . Fig. 1 is a simplified block diagram of the ultraviolet microscopy system developed at the Medical Electronics Center of Rockefeller Institute . By combining the talents of a medical man , Dr. Aterman , a biophysicist , Mr. Berkely , and an electronics expert , Dr. Zworykin , this novel technique has been developed which promises to open broad avenues to understanding life processes . Three different wavelengths of ultraviolet radiation are selected by the variable filters placed in front of the three mercury xenon lights which serve as the ultraviolet sources . These wavelengths are reflected in sequence through the specimen by the rotating mirror ; ; the specimen is magnified by the microscope . Instead of the observer's eye the image orthicon in the TV camera does the `` looking '' . The microscope and orthicon are both selected to operate well into the ultraviolet spectrum , which means that all lenses must be quartz . The video signal is amplified and then switched , in synchronism with the three ultraviolet light sources which are sequenced by the rotating mirror so that during one-twentieth of a second only one wavelength , corresponding to red , green , or blue , is seen . ( Note : Because of light leakage from one ultraviolet source to another , the lights are switched by a commutator-like assembly rotated by a synchronous motor . This assembly also supplies a 20-cps switching gate for the electronics circuitry . ) This is the same system as was used in the field-sequential color-TV system which preceded the present simultaneous system . Three separate amplifiers then drive a 21-inch tricolor tube . The result is a color picture of the specimen where the primary colors correspond to the three different ultraviolet wavelengths . Many of the cells and microorganisms which are transparent to visible light , absorb or reflect the much shorter wavelengths of the ultraviolet spectrum . Different parts of these cells sometimes absorb or reflect different wavelengths so that it is often possible to see internal portions of cells in a different color . Where the microscope under visible light may show only vague shadows or nothing at all , ultraviolet illumination and subsequent translation into a color TV picture reveal a wealth of detail . At the present time the research team which pioneered this new technique is primarily interested in advancing and perfecting it . Breathing -- electronically analyzed The medical title of `` Lobar Ventilation In Man '' by Drs. C. J. Martin and A. C. Young , covers a brief paper which is one part of a much larger effort to apply electronics to the study of the respiratory process . At the University of Washington Medical School , the electronics group has developed the `` Respiratory Gas Analyzer '' shown in Fig. 3 . This unit , affectionately dubbed `` The Monster '' , can be wheeled to any convenient location and provides a wealth of information about the patient's breathing . In the lower center rack an 8-channel recorder indicates the percentage of carbon dioxide and nitrogen from the upper and lower lobes of one lung , the total volume of inhalation per breath , the flow of air from both lobes , and the pressure of the two lobes with respect to each other . Usually the patient breathes into a mouthpiece while walking a treadmill , standing still , or in some other medically significant position . From the resulting data the doctor can determine lung defects with hitherto unknown accuracy and detail . Heart-measuring techniques The original electrocardiograph primarily indicates irregularities in the heartbeat , but today's techniques allow exact measurements of the flow of blood through the aorta , dimensioning of the heart and its chambers , and a much more detailed study of each heartbeat . For many of these measurements the chest must be opened , but the blood vessels and the heart itself remain undisturbed . A group of researchers at the University of Washington have given a paper which briefly outlines some of these techniques . One simple method of measuring the expansion of the heart is to tie a thin rubber tube , filled with mercury , around the heart and record the change in resistance as the tube is stretched . A balanced resistance bridge and a pen recorder are all the electronic instrumentation needed . Sonar can be used to measure the thickness of the heart by placing small crystal transducers at opposite sides of the heart or blood vessel and exciting one with some pulsed ultrasonic energy . The travel time of sound in tissue is about 1500 meters per second ; ; thus it takes about 16 Msec. to traverse 25 mm. of tissue . A sonar or radar-type of pulse generator and time-delay measuring system is required for body-tissue evaluation . In addition to the heart and aorta , successful measurements of liver and spleen have also been made by this technique . The Doppler effect , using ultrasonic signals , can be employed to measure the flow of blood without cutting into the blood vessel . A still more sophisticated system has been devised for determining the effective power of the heart itself . It uses both an ultrasonic dimensioning arrangement of the heart and a catheter carrying a thermistor inserted into the bloodstream . The latter measures the heat carried away by the bloodstream as an indication of the velocity of the blood flow . It is also possible to utilize a pressure transducer , mounted at the end of a catheter which is inserted into the heart's left ventricle , to indicate the blood pressure in the heart itself . This pressure measurement may be made at the same time that the ultrasonic dimensioning measurement is made . A simplified version of the instrumentation for this procedure is shown in Fig. 2 . Outputs of the two systems are measured by a pulse-timing circuit and a resistance bridge , followed by a simple analogue computer which feeds a multichannel recorder . From this doctors can read heart rate , change in diameter , pressure , and effective heart power . Radio-transmitter pills Several years ago headlines were made by a small radio transmitter capsule which could be swallowed by the patient and which would then radio internal pressure data to external receivers . This original capsule contained a battery and a transistor oscillator and was about 1 cm. in diameter . Battery life limited the use of this `` pill '' to about 8 to 30 hours maximum . A refinement of this technique has been described by Drs. Zworykin and Farrar and Mr. Berkely of the Medical Electronics Center of the Rockefeller Institute . In this novel arrangement the `` pill '' is much smaller and contains only a resonant circuit in which the capacitor is formed by a pressure-sensing transducer . As shown in Fig. 4 , an external antenna is placed over or around the patient and excited 3000 times a second with short 400-kc. bursts . The energy received by the `` pill '' causes the resonant circuit to `` ring '' on after the burst and this `` ringing '' takes place at the resonant frequency of the `` pill '' . These frequencies are amplified and detected by the FM receiver after each burst of transmitted energy and , after the `` pill '' has been calibrated , precise internal pressure indications can be obtained . One of the advantages of this method is that the `` pill '' can remain in the patient for several days , permitting observation under natural conditions . Applications to organs other than the gastrointestinal tract are planned for future experiments . Sonar in medical research One of the most gratifying applications of an important technique of submarine detection is in the exploration of the human body . Our readers are familiar with the principles of sonar where sound waves are sent out in water and the echoes then indicate submerged objects . Various methods of pulsing , scanning , and displaying these sound waves are used to detect submarines , map ocean floors , and even communicate under water . In medicine the frequencies are much higher , transducers and the sonar beams themselves are much smaller , and different scanning techniques may be used , but the principles involved are the same as in sonar . Because the body contains so much liquid , transmission of ultrasonic signals proceeds fairly well in muscles and blood vessels . Bones and cartilage transmit poorly and tend to reflect the ultrasonic signals . Based on this phenomenon , a number of investigators have used this method to `` look through '' human organs . A good example of the results obtainable with ultrasonic radiation is contained in papers presented by Dr. G. Baum who has explored the human eye . He can diagnose detachment of the retina where conventional methods indicate blindness due to glaucoma . The method used to scan the eye ultrasonically is illustrated in Fig. 6 . The transducer is coupled to the body through a water bath , not shown . For display , Dr. Baum uses a portion of an Af , an airborne radar indicator , and then photographs the screen to obtain a permanent record . A typical `` sonogram '' of a human eye , together with a description of the anatomical parts , is shown in Fig. 5 . The frequency used for these experiments is 15 mc. and the transducer is a specially cut crystal with an epoxy lens capable of providing beam diameters smaller than one millimeter . The transducer itself moves the beam in a sector scan , just like a radar antenna , while the entire transducer structure is moved over a 90-degree arc in front of the eye to `` look into '' all corners . The total picture is only seen by the camera which integrates the many sector scans over the entire 90-degree rotation period . Drs. Howry and Holmes at the University of Colorado Medical School have applied the same sonar technique to other areas of soft tissue and have obtained extremely good results . By submerging the patient in a tub and rotating the transducer while the scanning goes on , they have been able to get cross-section views of the neck , as shown in Fig. 7 , as well as many other hitherto impossible insights . As mentioned before , bone reflects the sound energy and in Fig. 7 the portion of the spine shows as the black area in the center . Arteries and veins are apparent by their black , blood-filled centers and the surrounding white walls . A cross-section of a normal lower human leg is shown in Fig. 8 with the various parts labeled . Oersted's boyhood represented a minimal chance of either attaining greatness or serving his people so well and over so long a span of life . He was born in the small Danish town of Rudkoebing on the island of Langeland in the south-central part of Denmark on August 14 , 1777 . His father Soeren was the village apothecary whose slender income made it difficult to feed his family , let alone educate them in a town without even a school . The two older boys , Hans and Anders , his junior by a year , therefore went daily to the home of a warm and friendly wigmaker nearby for instruction in German ; ; his wife taught the two boys to read and write Danish . Other brothers later joined them for instruction with Oldenburg , the wigmaker , and also arithmetic was added to Bible reading , German , and Danish in the informal curriculum . Oldenburg's contributions were soon exhausted and the boys had to turn to a wider circle of the town's learned , such as the pastor , to supplement the simple teaching . From the town surveyor , Hans learned drawing and mathematics and , from a university student , some academic subjects . The mayor of the town taught them English and French . Whatever Hans or Anders learned separately they passed on to each other ; ; they read every book that they could borrow in the village . At 12 , Hans was sufficiently mature to help his father in the apothecary shop , which helped stimulate his interest in medicine and science . His earlier love for literature and history remained with him for his entire life . In 1793 the brothers decided to enter the University of Copenhagen ( founded in 1479 ) and the following spring found them at the university preparing to matriculate for the autumn session . While Hans devoted himself to the sciences of medicine , physics , and astronomy , his brother studied law . The brothers continued to help each other during their studies , sharing a joint purse , lodging together in the dormitory and dining together at the home of their aunt . They supplemented their income by small government assistance , by tutoring and economizing wherever they could . So impressive were those serious years of study at the university that Hans later wrote , `` to be perfectly free , the young man must revel in the great kingdom of thought and imagination ; ; there is a struggle there , in which , if he falls , it is easy for him to rise again , there is freedom of utterance there , which draws after it no irreparable consequences on society . I lived in this onward-driving contest where each day overcame a new difficulty , gained a new truth , or banished a previous error '' . He openly proclaimed his pleasure in lecturing and writing about science . In this third year at the university , Hans , in 1797 , was awarded the first important token of recognition , a gold medal for his essay on `` Limits Of Poetry And Prose '' . He completed his training in pharmacy also , taking his degree with high honors in 1797 , and in 1799 was awarded the degree of Doctor of Philosophy along with a prize for an essay in medicine . He proposed a fresh theory of alkalis which later was accepted in chemical practices . Ferment of scientific activity Hans' student days were at a time when Europe was in a new intellectual ferment following the revolutions in America and in France , Germany and Italy were rising from divisive nationalisms and a strong wave of intellectual awareness was sweeping the Continent . The new century opened with Oersted beginning his professional career in charge of an apothecary shop in Copenhagen and as lecturer at the university . He was stirred by the announcement of Volta's discovery of chemical electricity and he immediately applied the voltaic pile to experiments with acids and alkalis . The following year he devoted to the customary `` Wanderjahr '' , traveling in Germany , France , and the Netherlands , meeting the philosophers Schelling , Fichte , and Tieck . He also met Count Rumford ( born Benjamin Thompson in Woburn , Mass. ) who was then serving the Elector of Bavaria , and the physicist Ritter ; ; these were Oersted's main contacts in science . From Gottingen ( 1801 ) where he stayed for 10 days , he wrote , `` The first question asked everywhere is about galvanism . As everybody is curious to see the battery of glass tubes I have invented , I have had quite a small one made here of four glass tubes ( in Copenhagen I used 30 ) and intend to carry it with me '' . Oersted joined Ritter at Jena and stayed with him for 3 weeks , continuing their correspondence after he left . With Ritter he was exposed to the fantastic profusion of ideas that stormed through his host's fertile but disorganized mind . Oersted remodeled Ritter's notes into an essay in French which was submitted to the Institut De France for its annual prize of 3,000 francs . The sound discoveries of this quixotic genius were so diluted by those of fantasy that the prize was never awarded to him . In May , 1803 , Ritter , in another flight of fancy , wrote to Oersted a letter that contained a remarkable prophecy . He related events on earth to periodic celestial phenomena and indicated that the years of maximum inclination of the ecliptic coincided with the years of important electrical discoveries . Thus , 1745 corresponded to the invention of the `` Leiden '' jar by Kleist , 1764 that of the electrophorus by Wilcke , 1782 produced the condenser of Volta , and 1801 the voltaic pile . Ritter proceeded , `` You now emerge into a new epoch in which late in the year 1819 or 1820 , you will have to reckon . This we might well witness '' . Ritter died in 1810 and Oersted not only lived to see the event occur but was the author of it . In 1803 Oersted returned to Copenhagen and applied for the university's chair in physics but was rejected because he was probably considered more a philosopher than a physicist . However , he continued experimenting and lecturing , publishing the results of his experiments in German and Danish periodicals . In 1806 his ambition was realized and he became professor of physics at the Copenhagen University , though not realizing full professorship ( ordinarius ) until 1817 . During Oersted's attendance at the university , it was poorly equipped with physical apparatus for experimenting in the sciences . He was , however , fortunate in his contact with Prof. J. G. L. Manthey ( 1769-1842 ) , teacher of chemistry , who , in addition to his academic chair , was also proprietor of the `` Lion Pharmacy '' in Copenhagen where Oersted assisted him . Manthey maintained a valuable collection of physical and chemical apparatus which was at Oersted's disposal during and after his graduation . In 1800 , Manthey went abroad and Oersted was appointed manager of the Lion Pharmacy . In February 1801 , Oersted did manage to experiment with physical apparatus and reported experiments made with a voltaic battery of 600 plates of zinc and silver and of later experiments with a battery of 60 plates of zinc and lead . In the following year , 1803 , Oersted , simultaneously with Davy , discovered that acids increased the strength of a voltaic battery more than did salts . Eager as he was to pursue this promising line , he was so loaded down with the management of the pharmacy and lectures in the medical and pharmaceutical faculties at the university that he could devote only Sunday afternoons to `` galvanizing '' . He assumed his academic career with the same intensity and thoroughness that had marked every step in his rise from boyhood . The university was the only one in Denmark and the status of professor represented the upper social level . His broad interest in literary , political , and philosophical movements opened many doors to him . His friends were numerous and their ties to him were strong . The years 1812 and 1813 saw him in Germany and France again , but on this visit to Berlin he did not seek out the philosophers as he had on his first journey . In Berlin he published his views of the chemical laws of nature in German and this was issued in French translation ( Paris , 1813 ) under the title Recherches Sur l'identite Des Forces chimiques et electriques , a work held in very high esteem by the new generation of research chemists . His interest in finding a relationship between voltaic electricity and magnetism is here first indicated . Chapter 8 , is entitled `` On Magnetism '' and in it are included such remarks as , `` One has always been tempted to compare the magnetic forces with the electrical forces . The great resemblance between electrical and magnetic attractions and repulsions and the similarity of their laws necessarily would bring about this comparison . It is true , that nothing has been found comparable with electricity by communication ; ; but the phenomena observed had such a degree of analogy to those depending on electrical distribution that one could not find the slightest difference . The form of galvanic activity is halfway between the magnetic form and the electrical form . There , forces are more latent than in electricity , and less than in magnetism . But in such an important question , we would be satisfied if the judgment were that the principal objection to the identity of forces which produce electricity and magnetism were only a difficulty , and not a thing which is contrary to it . One could also add to these analogies that steel loses its magnetism by heat , which proves that steel becomes a better conductor through a rise in temperature , just as electrical bodies do . It is also found that magnetism exists in all bodies of nature , as proven by Bruckmann and Coulomb . By that , one feels that magnetic forces are as general as electrical forces . An attempt should be made to see if electricity , in its most latent stage , has any action on the magnet as such '' . His plan and intent were clearly charted . Oersted returned in 1814 and resumed an active part in university and political discussions . In one debate he supported the freedom of judgment as opposed to dogma , in another he held that the practice of science was in fact an act of religious worship . He continued as a popular lecturer . He devised a detonating fuse in which a short wire was caused to glow by an electric current . In 1819 under royal command he undertook a very successful geological expedition to Bornholm , one of the Danish islands , being one of three scientists in the expedition . It was with the assistance of one of the members of this expedition , Lauritz Esmarch , that Oersted succeeded in producing light by creating an electric discharge in mercury vapor through which an electric current was made to flow . Together they also developed a new form of voltaic cell in which the wooden trough was replaced by one of copper , thereby producing stronger currents . Esmarch was among those who witnessed Oersted's first demonstration of his discovery . Discovery of electromagnetism the association between electric ( both electrostatic and voltaic ) forces and magnetic forces had been recognized by investigators for many decades . Electrical literature contained numerous references to lightning that had magnetized iron and had altered the polarity of compass needles . In the late 1700's Beccaria and Van Marum , among others , had magnetized iron by sending an electrostatic charge through it . Beccaria had almost stumbled on a lead to the relationship between electricity and magnetism when a discharge from a Leyden jar was sent transversally through a piece of watch-spring steel making its ends magnetic . The resulting magnetic effect proved stronger than when the discharge was made lengthwise . The experiments of Romagnosi and others have already been noted but no one had determined the cause-and-effect relationship between these two primary forces . Oersted's own earlier experiments were unimpressive , possibly because he had , like other experimenters , laid the conducting wire across the compass needle instead of parallel with it . The sequence of events leading to his important discovery still remains ambiguous but it seems that one of the advanced students at the university related that the first direct event that led to the publication of Oersted's discovery occurred during a private lecture made before a group of other advanced students in the spring of 1820 . At this lecture Oersted happened to place the conducting wire over and parallel to a magnetic needle . Knowing specifically what the many feed additives can do and how and when to feed them can make a highly competitive business more profitable for beef , dairy , and sheep men . The target chart quickly and briefly tells you which additives do what . All the additives listed here are sanctioned for use by the Food and Drug Administration of the federal government . All comments concerning effectiveness and use of drugs have been carefully reviewed by a veterinary medical officer with Aj . This article assumes that the rations you are feeding your beef , dairy cattle , and sheep are adequately balanced with protein , vitamins , and minerals . The drug's chemical name is listed , since most states require feed processors to use this name instead of the trade name on the feed tag . In some instances , the trade name is shown in parentheses following the chemical name . This indicates that this drug is being marketed under one trade name only or state regulatory organizations have approved its use on the feed tag .

There are three principal feed bunk types for dairy and beef cattle : ( 1 ) Fence-line bunks -- cattle eat from one side while feed is put in from the opposite side of the fence by self-unloading wagons ; ; ( 2 ) Mechanized bunks -- they sit within the feed lot , are filled by a mechanical conveyor above feeding surface ; ; ( 3 ) Special bunks -- as discussed here , they permit cattle to eat from all sides . Feed is put in with an elevator . Several materials or combinations of materials can be used to construct a satisfactory feed bunk . The selection of materials depends on skills of available labor for installation , cost of materials available locally , and your own preference . No one material is best for all situations . Selecting bunks by economic comparison is usually an individual problem . Fence-line feeding . Animals eat only from one side , so the fence-line bunk must be twice as long as the mechanical bunk . These bunks also serve as a fence , so part of the additional cost must be attributed to the fence . Because of their location , on the edge of the feed lot , fence-line bunks are not in the way of mechanical manure removal . Filling these bunks by the same self-unloading wagons used to fill silos spreads cost of the wagons over more time and operations . All-weather roads must be provided next to the feeding floor so access will be possible all year . This will be a problem in areas of heavy snowfall . Marketing in the new decade will be no picnic -- for the sixties will present possibly the most intense competitive activity that you have experienced in the last 20-25 yrs. . Why ? Companies of all types have made great advances in production capabilities and efficiencies -- in modern equipment and new processes , enlarged R & D facilities , faster new product development . Many companies have upgraded their sales manpower and tested new selling , distribution , and promotion techniques to gain a bigger competitive edge . Given this kind of business climate , what competitive marketing problems will your company face in the next 10 yrs. ? Based on our experience with clients , , we see 14 major problems which fall into three broad groups -- the market place itself , marketing methods , and marketing management . 1 . Problems in the market greater price-consciousness . There has been an intensification of price-consciousness in recent years ; ; there is every indication it will continue . Frequently , wittingly or unwittingly , price-consciousness has been fostered by manufacturers , distributors , and dealers . Despite generally good levels of income , we see greater price pressures than ever before -- traveling back along the chain from consumer to distributor to manufacturer . Here are some key areas to examine to make sure your pricing strategy will be on target : Has the probable price situation in your field been forecast as a basis for future planning ? Have cost studies been made of every phase of your operation to determine what might be done if things get worse ? Have you actually checked out ( not just mentally tested ) different selling approaches designed to counter the price competition problem ? Increased customer sophistication . Average consumer is becoming more sophisticated regarding product and advertising claims , partly because of widespread criticism of such assertions . This problem can force a change in marketing approach in many kinds of businesses . Have you examined this problem of increasing consumer sophistication from the standpoint of your own company ? Greater demand for services . Need for service is here to stay -- and the problem is going to be tougher to solve in the sixties . There are two reasons for this . First , most products tend to become more complex . Second , in a competitive market , the customer feels his weight and throws it around . Providing good customer service requires as thorough a marketing and general management planning job as the original selling of the product . Too often it is thought of at the last moment of new product introduction . Good service starts with product design and planning : Many products seem to be designed for a production economy , not for a service one . Proper follow-through requires training your own sales organization , and your distributor organizations , not only in the techniques but also in good customer relations . Have you assessed the importance of service and given it proper attention ? Wider discretionary choices for customers . In spending his money today , the consumer is pulled in many directions . To the manufacturer of the more convenient-type product -- the purchase of which can be switched , delayed , or put off entirely -- the implications are important . Your competition is now proportionately greater -- you are competing not only against manufacturers in the same field but also against a vast array of manufacturers of other appealing consumer products . Many industry trade associations are developing campaigns to protect or enhance the share of the consumer's dollar being spent on their particular products . Has your company thought through its strategy in this whole `` discretionary buying '' area ? Geographic shift of customers . The trends have been in evidence for many years -- population shifts to the Southwest and Far West , and from city to suburbs . These shifts will continue in the next 10 yrs. . Have you considered the implications of continuing geographic shifts in terms of sales force allocation , strength of distributor organizations , and even plant location ? Market concentration and distribution in fewer accounts . We have already witnessed great changes through mergers and acquisitions in the food industry -- at both the manufacturing and retail ends . Instead of relatively small sales to many accounts , there are now larger sales to or through fewer accounts . The change may require different products , pricing , packaging , warehousing , salesmanship , advertising and executive attention -- practically every link in the marketing network may have to be adjusted . Have you examined these trends , forecast the effects , and planned your marketing strategy to compete effectively under changing circumstances ? 2 . Problems in marketing methods more private label competition . In the area of private label competition , it is logical to expect a continuation of trends which have been under way during the first decade . As mass dealer and distributor organizations grow in size , there is every reason to expect them to try to share in the manufacturer's as well as the distributor's profits -- which is , in effect , what the sale of private brands tends to do . Average manufacturer frequently has helped build private brand business , delivering largely the same qualities and styles in private brand merchandise as in branded . Moreover , the larger and more aggressive mass distribution outlets and chain stores have insisted on high quality -- and the customer seems to have caught on . If you are up against private brand competition , have you formulated a long-term program for researching and strengthening your market position ? If private brand competition hasn't been felt in your product field as yet , have you thought how you will cope with it if and when it does appear ? Less personal salesmanship . Display merchandising , backed by pre-selling through advertising and promotion , will continue to make strides in the sixties . It has multiple implications and possible headaches for your marketing program . How can you cash in on this fast-growing type of outlet and still maintain relationships with older existing outlets which are still important ? If you have a higher-quality product , how can you make it stand out -- justify its premium price -- without the spoken word ? Salesmanship is still necessary , but it's a different brand of salesmanship . Have you carefully examined the selling techniques which best suit your products ? Have you studied the caliber and sales approaches of your sales force in relation to requirements for effective marketing ? Are you experimenting with different selling slants in developing new customers ? Higher costs of distribution generally . Some distribution costs are kept up by competitive pressure , some by the fact that the customers have come to expect certain niceties and flourishes . No manufacturer has taken the initiative in pointing out the costs involved . The use of bulk handling is continuously growing . Computers are being used to keep branch inventories at more workable levels . `` Selective selling '' -- concentrating sales on the larger accounts -- has been used effectively by some manufacturers . There may be possible economies at any one of a number of links in your marketing and distribution chain . Do you have a program for scrutinizing all these links regularly and carefully -- and with some imagination ? In your sales force , will a smaller number of higher-priced , high-quality salesmen serve you best , or can you make out better with a larger number of lower-paid salesmen ? Will your trade customers settle for less attention and fewer frills in return for some benefit they can share ? In one company covering the country with a high-quality sales force of 10 men , the president personally phones each major account every 6 mos. . As a result , distribution costs were cut , customer relations improved . Distribution costs are almost bound to increase in the sixties -- and you will never know what you can do to control them unless you study each element and experiment with alternative ways of doing the job . Higher costs of advertising and promotion . From the manufacturer's point of view , the increasing cost of advertising and promotion is a very real problem to be faced in the sixties . It is accentuated by the need for pre-selling goods , and private label competition . How much fundamental thinking and research has your company done on its advertising program ? Are you following competition willy-nilly -- trying to match dollar for dollar -- or are you experimenting with new means for reaching and influencing consumers ? Have you evaluated the proper place of advertising and all phases of promotion in your total marketing program -- from the standpoint of effort , money , and effectiveness ? Increasing tempo of new product development . Practically all forecasts mention new and exciting products on the horizon . Will you be out in the market place with some of these sales-building new products ? If competition beats you to it , this exciting new product era can have real headaches in store . On the other hand , the process of obsoleting an old product and introducing the new one is usually mighty expensive . As markets become larger and marketing more complex , the costs of an error become progressively larger . Is your R & D or product development program tuned in to the commercial realities of the market ? Are there regular communications from the field , or meetings of sales and marketing personnel with R & D people ? Technical knowledge is a wonderful thing , but it's useless unless it eventually feeds the cash register . Are there individuals in your organization who can shepherd a new product through to commercialization ; ; who can develop reliable estimates of sales volume , production , and distribution costs ; ; and translate the whole into profit and loss and balance sheet figures which management can act on with some assurance ? We have seen good new products shelved because no one had the assignment to develop such facts and plans -- and management couldn't make up its mind . 3 . Problems in marketing management shortage of skilled salesmen . There is a shortage of salesmen today . In the future , quantitative demand will be greater because of the expansion of the economy , and the qualitative need will be greater still . While many companies have done fine work in developing sales personnel , much of it has been product rather than sales training . Nor has the training been enough in relation to the need . Most marketing people agree it is going to take redoubled efforts to satisfy future requirements . Have you estimated your sales manpower needs for the future ( both quantitatively and qualitatively ) ? Has your company developed selection and training processes that are geared to providing the caliber of salesmen you will need in the next 10 yrs. ? Shortage of sales management talent . With the growing complexity of markets and intensity of competition , sales management , whether at the district , region or headquarters level , is a tough job today -- and it will be tougher in the future . Men qualified for the broader task of marketing manager are even more scarce due to the demanding combination of qualifications called for by this type of management work . The growth of business has outdistanced the available supply , and the demand will continue to exceed the supply in the sixties . Does your company have a program for selecting and developing sales and marketing management personnel for the longer term ? Does your management climate and your management compensation plan attract and keep top-notch marketing people ? Complexity of complete marketing planning . Every single problem touched on thus far is related to good marketing planning . `` Hip-pocket '' tactics are going to be harder to apply . Many food and beverage companies are already on a highly planned basis . They have to be . With greater investments in plant facilities , with automation growing , you can't switch around , either in volume or in product design , as much as was formerly possible -- or at least not as economically . Are planning and strategy development emphasized sufficiently in your company ? We find too many sales and marketing executives so burdened with detail that they are short-changing planning . Are annual marketing plans reviewed throughout your management group to get the perspective of all individuals and get everyone on the marketing team ? Do you have a long-term ( 5- or 10-yr. ) marketing program ? The key to effective marketing is wrapped up in defining your company's marketing problems realistically . Solutions frequently suggest themselves when you accurately pinpoint your problems , whether they be in the market , in marketing methods or in marketing management . If companies will take the time to give objective consideration to their major problems and to the questions they provoke , then a long constructive step will have been taken toward more effective marketing in next decade . The controversy of the last few years over whether architects or interior designers should plan the interiors of modern buildings has brought clearly into focus one important difference of opinion . The architects do not believe that the education of the interior designer is sufficiently good or sufficiently extended to compare with that of the architect and that , therefore , the interior designer is incapable of understanding the architectural principles involved in planning the interior of a building . Ordinary politeness may have militated against this opinion being stated so badly but anyone with a wide acquaintance in both groups and who has sat through the many round tables , workshops or panel discussions -- whatever they are called -- on this subject will recognize that the final , boiled down crux of the matter is education . It is true that most architectural schools have five year courses , some even have six or more . The element of public danger which enters so largely into architectural certification , however , would demand a prolonged study of structure . This would , naturally , lengthen their courses far beyond the largely esthetic demands of interior designer's training . We may then dismiss the time difference between these courses and the usual four year course of the interior design student as not having serious bearing on the subject . The real question that follows is -- how are those four years used and what is their value as training ? The American Institute of Interior Designers has published a recommended course for designers and a percentage layout of such a course . An examination of some forty catalogs of schools offering courses in interior design , for the most part schools accredited by membership in the National Association of Schools of Art , and a further `` on the spot '' inspection of a number of schools , show their courses adhere pretty closely to the recommendations . One or two of the schools have a five year curriculum , but the usual pattern of American education has limited most of them to the four-year plan which seems to be the minimum in acceptable institutions . The suggested course of the A.I.D. was based on the usual course offered and on the opinion of many educators as to curricular necessities . Obviously , the four year provision limits this to fundamentals and much desirable material must be eliminated . Without comparing the relative merits of the two courses -- architecture versus interior design -- let us examine the educational needs of the interior designer . To begin with , what is an interior designer ? `` The Dictionary Of Occupational Titles '' published by the U. S. Department of Labor describes him as follows : `` Designs , plans and furnishes interiors of houses , commercial and institutional structures , hotels , clubs , ships , theaters , as well as set decorations for motion picture arts and television . Makes drawings and plans of rooms showing placement of furniture , floor coverings , wall decorations , and determines color schemes . Furnishes complete cost estimates for clients approval . Makes necessary purchases , places contracts , supervises construction , installation , finishing and placement of furniture , fixtures and other correlated furnishings , and follows through to completion of project '' . In addition to this the U. S. Civil Service Bureau , when examining applicants for government positions as interior designers , expects that `` when various needed objects are not obtainable on the market he will design them . He must be capable of designing for and supervising the manufacture of any craft materials needed in the furnishings '' . This seems like a large order . The interior designer , then , must first be an artist but also understand carpentry and painting and lighting and plumbing and finance . Yet nobody will question the necessity of all this and any reputable interior designer does know all this and does practice it . And further he must understand his obligation to the client to not only meet his physical necessities but also to enhance and improve his life and to enlarge the cultural horizon of our society . Few will quarrel with the aim of the schools or with the wording of their curriculum . It is in the quality of the teaching of all this that a question may arise . The old established independent art schools try their best to fulfill their obligations . Yet even here many a problem is presented ; ; as in a recent design competition with a floor plan and the simple command -- `` design a luxury apartment '' ; ; no description of the client or his cultural level , no assertion of geographical area or local social necessities -- simply `` a luxury apartment '' . Working in a vacuum of minimal information can result only in show pieces that look good in exhibitions and catalogs and may please the public relations department but have little to do with the essence of interior design . It is possible , of course , to work on extant or projected buildings where either architect or owner will explain their necessities so that the student may get `` the feel '' of real interior design demands . Unfortunately , the purely synthetic problem is the rule . It is like medical schools in India where , in that fairy-land of religious inhibition , the dissection of dead bodies is frowned upon . Instead they learn their dissection on the bulbs of plants . Thus technical efficiency is achieved at the expense of actual experience . In the earlier years of training certain phases of the work must be covered and the synthetic problem has its use . But to continue to divorce advanced students from reality is inexcusable . Consultation with architects , clients , real estate men , fabric houses and furniture companies is essential to the proper development of class problems just as in actual work . Fortunately , although only a few years ago they held the student at arms length , today the business houses welcome the opportunity to aid the student , not only from an increased sense of community responsibility but also from the realization that the student of today is the interior designer of tomorrow -- that the student already is `` in the trade '' . Even the `` history of furniture '' can hardly be taught exclusively from photographs and lantern slides . Here , too , the reality of actual furniture must be experienced . The professional organizations such as American Institute of Interior Designers , National Society of Interior Designers , Home Fashions League and various trade associations , can and do aid greatly in this work . Certainly every educator involved in interior design should be a member and active in the work of one of these organizations . Not only should every educator above the rank of instructor be expected to be a member of one of the professional organizations , but his first qualification for membership as an educator should be so sharply scrutinized that membership would be equivalent to certification to teach the subject . Participation for the educator in this case , however , would have to be raised to full and complete membership . The largest of these organizations at present denies to the full time educator any vote on the conduct and standards of the group and , indeed , refuses him even the right to attach the customary initials after his name in the college catalog . This anomalous status of the educator cannot fail to lower his standing in the eyes of the students . The professor in turn dares not tolerate the influence in his classes of an organization in the policies and standards of which he has no voice . This seems somewhat shortsighted since if the absolute educational qualifications for membership which the organizations profess are ever enforced , the educator will have the molding of the entire profession in his hands . In one way the Institutes and Societies do a disservice to the schools . That is in the continuance of the `` grandfather clauses '' in their membership requirements . When these groups were first formed many prominent and accomplished decorators could not have had the advantage of school training since interior design courses were rare and undeveloped during their youth . Long hard years of `` on the job '' training had brought them to their competence . The necessity of that day has long disappeared . There is plenty of opportunity for proper education today . It is discouraging for students to realize that the societies do not truly uphold the standards for which they are supposed to stand . The reason and the day of `` grandfather clauses '' has long since passed . No one can deny that these `` back door '' admissions to membership provisions have been seriously abused nor that they have not resulted in the admission of downright incompetents to membership in supposedly learned societies . Beyond any question of curriculum and approach to subject must be the quality of the teachers themselves . It will occur to anyone that the teacher must have adequate education , a depth and breadth of knowledge far beyond the immediate necessities of his course plus complete dedication to his subject and to his students . The local decorator who rushes in for a few hours of teaching may but more likely may not have these qualifications . Nor will the hack , the Jack-of-all-trades , still found in some of the smaller art schools , suffice . Only a few years ago a middle western college circulated a request for a teacher of interior design . At the end of its letter was the information that applicants for this position `` must also be prepared to teach costume design and advertising art '' . This kind of irresponsibility toward their students can scarcely build a strong professional attitude in the future designer . We must build a corps of highly professional teachers of interior design who have had education , experience in the profession and are willing to take on the usual accompaniments of teaching -- minimal income and minimal status among their confreres . Considerable specialization in teaching subjects such as architecture , furniture design , textiles and color is also desirable . In all `` degree '' courses in interior design a number of `` academic '' or `` general studies '' courses are included . It is only fair to demand that teachers of courses in English , history , psychology and so on be as well informed in matters of art , especially interior design , as are the art teachers educated in the academic subjects . The proper correlation of the art with the academic can be achieved only if this standard is observed . The matter of sympathy of the academic professors for art objectives also must be taken into account . One technical question of school organization comes to mind here . For proper accreditation of schools , teachers in any course must have a degree at least one level above that for which the student is a candidate . Since there are almost no schools in the country offering graduate work in interior design this rule cannot at present be observed . Indeed , it has only been a matter of the last few years that reputable schools of art have granted degrees at all . The question , however , cannot be ignored for long . The basic problem involved is that a college setting up a graduate school must have an entirely separate faculty for the advanced degree . Most professors in the course must , naturally , again have a higher degree than the course offers . One solution is the aquisition of degrees in education but it is a poor substitute . It is a sort of academic ring-around-a-rosy and you solve it . This brings us to the question of accreditation of art schools in general . Only the independent art schools , that is , those not connected with any university or college , receive severe and separate investigation before accreditation by the various regional organizations . It has been the custom for most universities to stretch the blanket of accreditation for their liberal arts school to cover the shivering body of their fine arts department . This , plus the habit of many schools of simply adding interior design to the many subjects of their home economics department , yet , nevertheless , claiming that they teach interior design , has contributed to the low repute of many university courses in interior design . In spite of this , many universities offer adequate and even distinguished courses in the subject . There will be no mitigation of these offences until all art schools , whether independent or attached to universities have separate accreditation -- as do medical schools -- by an art accreditation group such as the `` National Association of Schools of Art '' . Independent art schools granting degrees must , naturally , follow this with academic accreditation by the appropriate regional group . General How long has it been since you reviewed the objectives of your benefit and service program ? Have you permitted it to become a giveaway program rather than one that has the goal of improved employee morale and , consequently , increased productivity ? What effort do you make to assess results of your program ? Do you measure its relation to reduced absenteeism , turnover , accidents , and grievances , and to improved quality and output ? Have you set specific objectives for your employee publication ? Is it reaching these goals ? Is it larger or fancier than you really need ? Are you using the most economical printing methods , paper , etc. . Are there other , cheaper communications techniques that could be substituted ? Has your attitude toward employee benefits encouraged an excess of free `` government '' work in your plant ? Is your purchasing agent offering too much free-buying service for employees ? When improvements are recommended in working conditions -- such as lighting , rest rooms , eating facilities , air-conditioning -- do you try to set a measure of their effectiveness on productivity ? When negotiating with your union , do you make sure employees have a choice between new benefits and their cents-per-hour cost in wages . Can you consider restricting any additional employee benefits to those paid for by profit-sharing money , such as was done in the union contract recently signed by American Motors Corporation ? Insurance Do your employees understand all the benefits to which your insurance entitles them ? Are they encouraged to take full legal advantage of these benefits ? Have you publicized the cents-per-hour value of the company's share of insurance premiums ? When did you last compare your present premium costs with the costs of insurance from other sources ? Can your insurance company aid you in reducing administrative costs ? Do you try to maintain the principle of employee-contributed ( as opposed to fully company-paid ) programs ? Holidays , time off , overtime Do you protect your holiday privileges with an attendance requirement both before and after the holiday ? Do you plan to limit additional holidays to area and/or industrial patterns ? Have you investigated the possibility of moving midweek holidays forward to Monday or back to Friday in order to have an uninterrupted work week ? Are you carefully policing wash-up time and rest periods to be certain that all other time is productive ? Are you watching work schedules for boiler operators , guards , and other 24-hour-day , 7-day-week operations in order to minimize overtime ? Are you careful to restrict the number of people on leave at one time so that your total employment obligation is minimized ? Plant feeding facilities Have you considered using vending equipment to replace or reduce the number of cafeteria employees ? What are the possibilities for operating your cafeteria for a single shift only and relying upon vending machines or prepackaged sandwiches for the second- and third-shift operations ? Have you checked the cost of subcontracting your cafeteria operation in order to save administrative costs ? Are there possibilities of having cafeteria help work part-time on custodial or other jobs ? Can staggered lunch periods relieve the capacity strain on your feeding facilities ? Would it be feasible to limit the menu in order to reduce feeding costs ? Have you considered gradual withdrawal of subsidies to your in-plant feeding operation ? Are you utilizing cafeteria space for company meetings or discussions ? Recreation facilities Are your expenses in this area commensurate with the number of employees who benefit from your program ? Have you audited your program recently to weed out those phases that draw least participation ? Do employees contribute their share of money to recreational facilities ? Have you considered delegating operational responsibility to your employee association and carefully restricting your plant's financial contribution ? Could an employee's garden club take over partial care of plant grounds ? Would a camera club be useful in taking pictures pertinent to plant safety ? Are you spending too much money on team uniforms that benefit only a few employees ? Are you underwriting expensive team trips ? Are you utilizing vending machine proceeds to help pay for your program ? Transportation and parking Do you know the trend in your cost of maintaining access roads and parking lots ? If you use parking attendants , can they be replaced by automatic parking gates ? Will your local bus company erect and/or maintain the bus stops at your plant ? If you provide inter-plant transportation , can this be replaced by available public transportation ? If you use company transportation to meet trains or to haul visitors , would taxis be cheaper ? How efficient and necessary are your intra-company vehicles ? Can they be re-scheduled ? Can part-time drivers be assigned to other productive work ? Paid vacations Which is more economical for your plant -- a vacation shutdown or spaced vacations that require extra employees for vacation fill-ins ? Can vacations be spaced throughout the 12 months to minimize the number of employee fill-ins ? Do you insist that unneeded salary employees take their vacations during plant shutdowns ? What can your sales and purchasing departments do to curtail orders , shipments , and receipts during vacation shutdown periods ? Retirement Is an arbitrary retirement age of 65 actually costing your plant money ? What sort of effort do you make to assure that older or disabled workers are fully productive ? Would early retirement of non-productive , disabled employees reduce the number of make-work jobs ? Will your union accept seniority concessions in assigning work for older or disabled employees ? Medical and health Can you share medical facilities and staff with neighboring plants ? If you have a full-time doctor now , can he be replaced with a part-time doctor or one who serves on a fee-per-case basis only ? Can your plant nurse be replaced by a trained first-aid man who works full-time on some other assignment ? Do you rigidly distinguish between job- and non-job-connected health problems and avoid treating the latter ? Are you indiscriminantly offering unnecessary medical services -- flu shots , sun lamp treatments , etc. ? If you have an annual or regular physical examination program , is it worth what it is costing you ? A program to fit your needs Consider what you can afford to spend and what your goals are before setting up or revamping your employee benefit program . Too many plant officials are all too eager to buy a package program from an insurance company simply because it works for another plant . But even if that other plant employs the same number of workers and makes the same product , there are other facts to consider . How old is your working force ? What's your profit margin ? In what section of the country are you located ? Are you in a rural or urban area ? These factors can make the difference between waste and efficiency in any benefit program . Above all , don't set up extravagant fringe benefits just to buy employee good will . Unions stress fringe benefits , but the individual hourly worker prefers cash every time . Aim to balance your employee benefit package . Some plants go overboard on one type of fringe -- say a liberal retirement plan -- and find themselves vulnerable elsewhere . They're asking for union trouble . Communications If you want credit for your employee services program , let your workers know what they're entitled to . Encourage them to exercise their benefits . This can be done by stories in your house organs , posters , special publications , letters to workers' homes as well as by word of mouth through your chain of command . Some companies find a little imagination helpful . Hallmark Cards , Inc. , Kansas City , Mo. , has a do-it-yourself quiz game called `` Benefit Bafflers '' , which it distributes to employees . M & R Dietetic Laboratories , Inc. , Columbus , gives all its workers a facsimile checkbook -- each check showing the amount the company spends on a particular fringe . U. S. Rubber Company , New York , passes out a form itemizing the value of benefits . The blue-collar worker thus knows his insurance package , for example , costs $227.72 . Insurance Have the insurance company or your own accounting department break down the cost of your insurance package periodically . You may find certain coverage costing much more than is economically feasible , thereby alerting you to desirable revisions . Check to see if some of your benefits -- such as on-the-job disability pay -- can be put on a direct payment rather than an insured basis at a savings to you . Use deductable insurance wherever feasible . It can put an end to marginal claims which play havoc with your insurance rates . Also , beware of open-end policies , especially in the medical field . This will mean that every time there's an increase in hospital rates your cost will go up in like manner . Put a dollar-and-cents limit on benefits . Don't go overboard on insurance that pays benefits only upon death . Generally , your employee will greatly appreciate benefits that protect him during his working life or during retirement . Special time off In granting bereavement leaves , specify the maximum time off and list what the worker's relation to the deceased must be to qualify . Thus , you avoid headaches when an employee wants off for his fourth cousin's funeral . Also , reserve the right to demand proof of death despite the fact that you'll probably never use it . Coffee breaks can be a real headache if not regulated . Vending machines can alleviate the long hike to the cafeteria during the break with resulting waste of production time . If coffee is sold at the cafeteria , let a few workers in each department get it for the whole group . Consider installing supplemental serving lines in production areas . Make sure milk for the coffee is placed in dispensers rather than in containers , if you are supplying the coffee . Otherwise , you may be saddled with a good-size milk bill by milk drinkers . Retirement policies Keep the retirement age flexible so skilled craftsmen such as tool and die makers can be kept on the job for the convenience of the company . And so deadheads on the payroll can be eased out at the earliest possible age . Make sure you have minimum age and time-on-the-job requirements tied into your pension plan . Younger men usually don't think of pensions as an important job benefit factor anyhow and they're liable to change jobs several times before settling down . Choose carefully between contributory or non-contributory pension plans . There are two sides of a coin for this decision . Workers usually think more of a plan they contribute to . And they can at least collect the money they put in , plus interest , when they leave the company . A non-contributory plan usually won't pay off for the worker until he retires . Thus , there is an added incentive to stay on the job . Holidays Make sure you don't pay for holidays that occur when an employee would not otherwise be working . These include : leaves of absences , illnesses , and layoffs . Consider adopting a system of holidays in which time off is granted with an eye to minimum inconvenience to the operation of the plant . It's usually not too hard to sell workers on this as it gives them longer holiday periods . For example , the Friday after Thanksgiving can be substituted for Washington's birthday . This reduces the number of expensive plant shutdowns and startups . Require each employee to work his last shift both before and after the holiday to be eligible for pay . This cuts the absentee rate . Eating facilities Consider using vending machines rather than subsidized cafeterias . Latest models serve hot meals at reasonable prices , and at a profit to you . If a concessionaire runs the cafeteria , keep an eye out for quality and price . If the soup tastes like dishwater , your employees won't blame the concessionaire . You'll take the rap . Check your cafeteria location to make sure it's convenient for most employees . You may save valuable production minutes with a change . Vacations Spread your vacation period over the widest possible span of time or shut the plant down for two weeks . This will cut the expense of vacation replacements . And with the shutdown method there will be no argument as to who gets the choice vacation dates . Also make sure you have reasonable requirements as to hours worked before a production employee is entitled to a vacation . You might try providing standard vacation time off but make the vacation pay depend on the number of hours worked in the previous year . The long and ever-increasing column of sportsmen is now moving into a new era . Modern times have changed the world beyond recognition . The early years of the twentieth century seem very far away . But with all the changes in philosophy , dress and terrain -- a few things remain constant , including the devotion of Americans to the great field sports , hunting and fishing . As the generations move on , clothes become more suitable for the enjoyment of outdoor sports . Sporting firearms change , markedly for the better . Just as modern transportation has outmoded the early Studebaker covered wagon , the demand of today's sportsmen and women has necessitated changes in their equipment . The American firearms and ammunition manufacturers through diligent research and technical development have replaced the muzzle loader and slow-firing single-shot arms with modern fast firing auto-loaders , extremely accurate bolt , lever , and slide action firearms . And millions of rounds of entirely new and modern small-arms ammunition , designed for today's hunting and target shooting . And due to modern resource-use and game management practices , there is still game to shoot , even with the ever-expanding encroachment on land and water . Present conservation practices regard wildlife , not as an expendable natural resource , but as an annual harvest to be sown and also reaped . Unlimited game bags are possible and legal in more than 40 states , on shooting preserves ( one of the newer phases of modern game-management ) for five and six months each year . Close to two million game birds were harvested on 1,500 commercial and private shooting preserves , and on State Game Commission-controlled upland game areas during the 1960-61 season . The shooting development program of the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute has successfully published these facts in all major outdoor magazines , many national weeklies and the trade papers . The most effective way to develop more places for more sportsmen to shoot is to encourage properly managed shooting preserves . This has been the aim of the director of the shooting development program , the New York staff of the Sportsmen's Service Bureau , and the SAAMI shooting preserve field consultants since the start of the program in 1954 . Following the kick-off of SAAMI's shooting development program in 1954 , a most interesting meeting took place in Washington , D.C. . The group known as the American Association for Health , , Physical Education , and Recreation ( a division of the National Education Association ) initiated a conference which brought together representatives of the National Rifle Association , SAAMI and the American Fishing Tackle Manufacturers . This meeting was called to determine how these groups might cooperate to launch what is known as the Outdoor Education Project . The Outdoor Education Project took cognizance of the fact , so often overlooked , that athletic activities stressed in most school programs have little or no relationship to the physical and mental needs and interests of later life . The various team sports assuredly have their place in every school , and they are important to proper physical development . But with the exception of professional athletes , few contact sports and physical education activities in our schools have any carryover in the adult life of the average American man or woman . Following a vigorous campaign of interpretation and leadership development by OEP director Dr. Julian Smith , today thousands of secondary schools , colleges and universities have shooting and hunting education in their physical education and recreation programs . SAAMI's financial support since 1955 has contributed to the success of this project in education . Personnel assigned through the shooting development program have proudly participated in over 53 state and regional workshops , at which hundreds of school administrators , teachers , professors , and recreational leaders have been introduced to Outdoor Education . Considering that the current school-age potential is 23 million youths , the project and its message on hunting and shooting education have many more to reach . In 1959 SAAMI's shooting development program announced a new activity designed to expose thousands of teen-age boys and girls to the healthy fun enjoyed through the participation in the shooting sports . This program is now nationally known as `` Teen Hunter Clubs '' . Teen Hunter Clubs were initially sponsored by affiliated members of the Allied Merchandising Corporation . The first program was sponsored by Abraham & Strauss , Hempstead , New York , under the direction of Special Events director Jennings Dennis . Other pilot programs were conducted by A & S , Babylon , New York ; ; J. L. Hudson , Detroit ; ; Joseph Horne , Pittsburgh . Other THC activities followed , conducted by shopping centers , department stores , recreation equipment dealers , radio-TV stations , newspapers , and other organizations interested in the need existing to acquaint youngsters with the proper use of sporting firearms and the development of correct attitudes and appreciations related to hunting and wise use of our natural resources . SAAMI's field men have served as consultants and/or have participated in 75 Teen Hunter Club activities which have reached over 40,000 enthusiastic young Americans . Through the efforts of SAAMI's shooting development program these shooting activities , and many others , including assists in the development of public and privately financed shooting parks , trap and skeet leagues , rifle and pistol marksmanship programs have been promoted , to mention only a few . The continuation and expansion of the shooting development program will assure to some degree that national and community leaders will be made aware of the ever-growing need for shooting facilities and activities for hunting and shooting in answer to public demand . While individual sportsmen are aware of this situation , too many of our political , social , educational and even religious leaders too often forget it . Help is needed from dealers , at the grass-roots level . The American gun and ammunition producers sponsor a successful promotional program through their industry trade association . Since SAAMI's conception in 1926 , and more specifically since the adoption of the Shooting Development Program in 1954 , millions of dollars and promotional man-hours have gone into the development of more places to shoot for more youths and adults . We trust that you , as a gun and ammunition dealer , have benefited through additional sales of equipment . Are you getting top dollar from the shooting sports ? Are you looking ahead to the exploding market of millions of American boys and girls , who will grow up to enjoy a traditional American way of life -- ranging the fields with a fine American gun and uniformly excellent ammunition ? Is your sporting firearms and ammunition department primed for the expanding horizons ? Would you like to organize Teen Hunters Clubs , shooting programs , and have information on seasons including six months of hunting with unlimited game bags on shooting preserves ? Ask Sammy Shooter . We were camping a few weeks ago on Cape Hatteras Campground in that land of pirates , seagulls and bluefish on North Carolina's famed Outer Banks . This beach campground with no trees or hills presents a constant camping show with all manner of equipment in actual use . With the whole camp exposed to view we could see the variety of canvas shelters in which Americans are camping now . There were umbrella tents , wall tents , cottage tents , station wagon tents , pup tents , Pop tents , Baker tents , tents with exterior frames , camper trailers , travel trailers , and even a few surplus parachutes serving as sunshades over entire family camps . Moving around camp we saw all kinds of camp stoves , lanterns , coolers , bedding , games , fishing tackle , windbreaks and sunshades . We saw similar displays in the other three campgrounds in this 70-mile-long National Seashore Recreation Area . Dealers would do well to visit such a campground often , look at the equipment and talk with the campers . Here you begin to appreciate the scope of the challenges and possibilities facing the industry . Camping is big and getting bigger . No one knows where it will stop . Almost every official who reflects on it thinks this movement of Americans to canvas dwellings opens one of the most promising of all outdoor markets . You read various guesses on how many Americans are camping . The number depends on who is talking at the moment . The figures range as high as 15 million families . I've heard 10 million mentioned often , but I'm more inclined to think there may be a total of some five to seven million families camping . Seven million families would total 30 million Americans or more . Consider the equipment needed to protect this many from the weather , to make their cooking easy and their sleeping comfortable . More campers than campsites Harassed state park officials often have more campers than they know what to do with . They are struggling to meet the demand for camping space , but families are being turned away , especially on holiday weekends . The National Parks , always popular camping places , are facing the same pressure . The National Park Service hopes by 1966 to have 30,000 campsites available for 100,000 campers a day -- almost twice what there are at present . The U.S. Forest Service cares for hundreds of thousands of campers in its 149 National Forests and is increasing its facilities steadily . But the campers still come . They bring their families and tents and camp kitchens and bedding . They bring their fishing rods and binoculars and bathing suits . They come prepared for family fun because Americans in ever-growing numbers are learning that here is the way to a fine economical vacation that becomes a family experience of lasting importance . Why they keep coming There are a half dozen reasons helping to account for the migration to the campgrounds . Among them , according to the U.S. Department of Commerce , are : ( 1 ) shorter work weeks , ( 2 ) higher pay , ( 3 ) longer paid vacations , ( 4 ) better transportation , ( 5 ) earlier retirement , and ( 6 ) more education . The more people learn about their country , the more they want to learn . Camping is family fun , and it is helping more Americans see more of the country than they ever saw before . But make no mistake about it , the first reason people turn to camping is one of economy . Here is the promise of a vacation trip they can afford . The American Automobile Association , computing the cost for two people to vacation by automobile , comes up with an average daily expenditure figure of $29 . The AAA then splits it down this way : $10.50 for meals , $9.50 for lodging , $7 for gas and oil , and $2 for tips and miscellaneous . What does the camping couple do to this set of figures ? The $9.50 for lodging they save . Because they prepare their own meals they also keep in their pockets a good portion of that $10.50 food bill along with most of the tip money . The automobile expenses are about the only vacationing cost they can't either eliminate or pare down drastically by camping along the way . Where Americans used to think of a single vacation each summer , they now think about how many vacations they can have . Long weekends enable many to get away from home for three or four days several times a year . And even if they stay in resorts part of the time , they might , if the right salesman gets them in tow , develop a yearning to spice the usual vacation fare with a camping trip into the wide open spaces . It would be a mistake to sell those thousands of beginning campers on the idea they're buying the comforts of home . They're not . Home is the place to find the comforts of home . They're buying fun and adventure and family experiences . But it would also be a mistake for them not to realize how comfortable camping has become . This is no longer a way of life for the bearded logger and the wandering cowboy . Today's campers want comforts , and they have them . And this helps explain why so many people are now going camping . It's fun , and it's easy -- so easy that there is time left after cooking , and tent keeping , for the women to get out and enjoy outdoor fun with their families . Camp meals are no great problem . Neither are beds , thanks to air mattresses and sleeping bags . Neither are shelters , because there is one to meet the needs of every camper or prospective camper . But there is still the sometimes complex problem of helping campers choose the best equipment for their individual needs . Throughout history , the man who showed superior performance has become the commander of others -- for good or bad . Since the Industrial Revolution , when factories emerged , this classical pattern has been followed . Until recently . There have always been tales of disillusionment -- the competent technician who became an administrator , willingly or not , and found he didn't like it ; ; the scientist who rebelled against the personnel and paper work ; ; and much more commonly in recent years , the engineer who found that other duties interfered with -- or eliminated -- his engineering contributions . There have been many extremely competent men who have been converted into very incompetent managers or submerged in paper work , to their own and the public's dissatisfaction and loss . This has been more evident since our products have incorporated astronomically increased technology . The remedies have been many and varied -- attempts to teach management techniques -- either in plant , at special schools , or in university `` crash '' courses -- provision of management-trained assistants or associates . But the realization has been growing that these are not the complete answer . Some men have no talent for or interest in management ; ; forcing them into management can only create trouble . The old shop adage still holds : `` A good mechanic is usually a bad boss '' . Yet our economy clings inexorably to recognition of managerial status as the gage of success . Labor fights to change its collar from blue to white . All grades of management seek more resounding titles and incomes because of social pressures . As several recent books have over-emphasized , we have become the most status-conscious nation in the world . What can be done for the `` individual contributor '' who is extremely important -- and likely to be more so -- in the operation of the technically oriented company ? He is usually conscious of the social pressures at home and outside ; ; usually concerned about America's belief that attainment and success are measured in dollars and titles . Yet titles are traditionally given only to management men , and income tends to rise with title . Even the college professor in America has been affected . It is , as one engineer says , `` indeed a difficult thing for the engineer to accept that he can go as far on his technical merit as he could employing managerial skills . This difficulty arises even though we can give examples of men who have actually followed this course . This leads one to conclude , as you have , that there is inevitably more prestige in a management position in the minds of our people '' . Nobody should be more able to answer the questions on this score than engineering vice-presidents and chief engineers . So we asked such men in major companies in the design field to offer their opinions on the `` dual-road-up '' problem -- and more importantly -- their solutions . In the paragraphs that follow , we quote from 32 men who are identified on the final page . First : what title , what setup ? ? Among the more familiar plans for dual-channel advancement is that of General Electric . This is not a mutually exclusive plan ; ; there is no one point in a man's career at which he must select either the technical or the managerial path upward . Further , the management path does not open the door to higher opportunities than are offered by the more technical path . It is common to shift back and forth , working up through a number of supervisory and individual-contributor positions . Actually , there are a number of individual-contributor positions in both operating departments and in the company-wide `` services '' operation that are filled by men with successful managerial experience who are currently broadening their capabilities . Also , moving into a managerial position does not necessarily end a man's recognition as a technical expert . As examples at GE : Glen B. Warren , formerly manager of the Turbine Division , widely recognized as a turbine designer . The late W. R. G. Baker , a pioneer in television design and long-time vp & gm of the Electronics Division , and later , by his own choice , an individual consultant . Harold E. Strang , expert in switchgear design , for a long period vp & gm of the Measurements & Industrial Products Division , and who currently , approaching retirement , is vice-president and consulting engineer in the Switchgear & Control Division . In the GE plan , a number of individual contributors have positions and compensation higher than those of many managers . These positions carry such titles as : Consultant , Advanced Development Consulting Engineer , Consulting Engineer , Heat Transfer Consulting Electrical Engineer , Senior Electrical Engineer , Senior Physicist . Westinghouse has a similar system , with two classifications representing various levels of competence on the strictly technical side : consulting engineer or scientist , as the case may be , and advisory engineer or scientist . Many companies have systems , particularly in R & D , which work more or less well , depending upon size and actual belief in the policy on the part of administration , as will be abundantly apparent in subsequent quotations . Another factor that may hold hope is for parallel recognition is , as one man says it : `` that the fad for educating top people along managerial lines is yielding to the technically trained approach '' . Senior staff engineer ? ? One company instituted , early in 1959 , a vertical classification system consisting of four levels . There is no formal equivalence to the supervisory ranks ; ; the top non-supervisory level , senior staff engineer , enjoys status and pay ranging up to that for the second level of engineering supervision . The second level , senior engineer , rates slightly below first-level supervision . The expectation is that first-level supervisors will be selected in approximately equal numbers from the second and third engineering level , with very few coming from the first level . The company expects to extend upward both compensation and status for non-supervisory engineers , but probably not into executive levels . In this organization , about half of the engineers with 15 or more years of employment are in supervision , engineering or elsewhere . This reflects the very heavy engineering content of the products -- which are not military . Several other examples : central and satellite `` We have over 20 divisions -- each of which has an engineering department headed by a chief engineer . We have set up a central R & D department , as well as engineering-management departments -- about 80 people working on problems related to those of our plants . A separate research department is , of course , confined to new or future designs . Part of this headquarters staff , however , are engineering managers who work between divisional chief engineers and headquarters management . These headquarters engineers , headed by the vice-president -- Engineering , counsel and advise divisional managers and chief engineers on product problems as well as aid with design ; ; and many are engineers who have been advanced from the divisions . These men are considered managers of engineers . They must learn to wear several hats , so to speak , working with management , sales and engineering problems related to the product . `` We do not have people in our organization termed ' consultants ' or ' fellows ' , who are specialists in one particular technical subject . I suppose it is because we are just not big enough . We have a few ' consultants ' -- retired engineers retained and called in on certain problems . The only ' fellows ' in our company are those who have been honored by ASME , AIEE or AIChE . I am sure that the engineer who enters management is nearly always opening the door to greater possibilities than he would have as a technical specialist -- because of his wider accountability '' . Another structure `` We have tried to make both paths attractive , so that good men could find opportunity and satisfaction in either . One way to formalize this is in the job structure . We have these positions , which compare directly : Af `` Above these jobs we have chief engineer for the company and vice-president of Engrg , R & Aj . The latter jobs include major management responsibilities and have been filled by those who have come up primarily through the engineering-management side . We have not yet succeeded in establishing recognition of technical specialization comparable to our higher levels of management , but I believe we will trend in this direction but not to exceed vice-president '' . Top job : research scientist `` . Approximately four years ago , we initiated a dual ladder of advancement for technical persons . The highest position is known as a ' research scientist . This approach has not been entirely satisfactory . The primary deterrent appears to lie with the technical people themselves , and their concept of what constitutes status in present-day society . Scientists who agitate hardest for technical recognition are often the most reluctant to accept it . We have discovered that the outward trappings such as private offices and private secretaries are extremely important ; ; and although we have attempted to provide these status symbols , support of the ' dual-ladder ' plan has been half-hearted despite the creation of a salary potential for a research scientist commensurate with that of men in top managerial positions . `` A serious problem accompanying the technical-ladder approach is the difficulty of clearly defining responsibilities and standards of performance for each level . With no set standards , there is the tendency to promote to the next highest level when the top of a salary band is reached regardless of performance . Promotion is too often based on longevity and time in salary grade instead of merit . If no specific organization plan exists limiting the number of scientists at each salary level , the result is a department top-heavy with high-level , high-salaried personnel '' . Staff engineer dept. manager `` We have two approaches for the technical man : the position of staff engineer , which is rated as high in salary as department manager ; ; and an administrative organization to take the routine load away from department managers and project engineers as much as possible , thus allowing them more time for strictly technical work . These are only halfway measures , and the answer will come when some way is found to allow the technical man in industry to progress without limit in salary and prestige '' . A complete plan `` We have made limited application of the ' parallel ladder ' plan . The highest rated non-supervisory engineering title is ' research engineer . The salary schedule permits remuneration greater than the average paid to the first level of engineering supervision ( engineering section head ) . We also have an ' engineering section head -- research engineer ' classification which has salary possibilities equivalent to that of a research engineer . Above this point there is no generally used parallel ladder . `` We also do a number of things to build up the prestige of the engineer as a ' professional ' and also to give public recognition to individual technical competence . These include encouragement of , and assistance to , the engineer in preparation and publication of technical papers . We have two media for publicizing individual technical activity , a magazine widely distributed both within and without the company , and an information bulletin for engineering personnel distributed to the homes of all engineers . Publicity is given to the award of patents to our engineers and financial support is provided for individual membership in technical societies . `` A recent , and more pertinent action , has been the establishment of a technical staff reporting to the vice-president for Engineering . This function is staffed by engineers chosen for their technical competence and who have the title , member of the technical staff . Salaries compare favorably with those paid to the first two or three levels of management . Additional symbols of status are granted , such as reserved parking , distinctive badge passes authorizing special privileges , and a difference in the treatment of financial progress through merit . `` We presently are involved in inaugurating a new development center . Operations of this nature offer the best opportunity to recognize scientific status . All scientific staff members will have the title , ' research-staff member . The salary level of an individual within the group will reflect the scientific community's acceptance of him as an authority in his scientific field . Contrary to usual organization-position evaluations , the position to which research-staff members report administratively will not necessarily encompass the duties of the research-staff member , therefore , are not necessarily evaluated as highly . `` These recent steps do not offer the possibility of extension to the great number of senior engineers who have displayed technical competence . It is doubtful that the complete solution to the over-all problem can result entirely from company efforts . Fundamental to the difficulty of creating the desired prestige is the fact that , in the business community , prestige and status are conferred in proportion to the authority that one man has over others and the extent of which he participates in the management functions '' . Sixty miles north of New York City where the wooded hills of Dutchess County meet the broad sweep of the Hudson River there is a new home development called `` Oakwood Heights '' . As a matter of fact you could probably find a new home development in every populated county in the country with three-bedroom ranch style cottages in the $14,000 range . But Oakwood Heights is unique in one particular . Its oil for heating is metered monthly to each home from a line that starts at a central storage point . This is a pilot operation sponsored by a new entity chartered in Delaware as the Tri-State Pipeline Corporation , with principal offices in New York State . Its president is Otis M. Waters , partner in the law firm of Timen & Waters , 540-K Chrysler Bldg. , New York City . Vice-president is Louis Berkman and the secretary-treasurer is Mark Ritter . Ritter is the builder of Oakwood Heights and president of Kahler-Craft Distributors , Inc. , Newburgh , N.Y. . The idea of a central tank with lines to each house is not in itself a novelty . Not a year goes by but what several local companies in the U.S. and Canada , even overseas , write to Fueloil & Oil Heat to inquire if it's feasible and where it is being done . Its editors only knew of one example to point to , a public housing development of 278 homes in New Haven described by John Schulz in the March , 1950 issue . This has survived the years but there has been considerable concern among the tenants over the fact that the oil was not metered . Rather the monthly total consumption was divided and charged on the basis of number of rooms and persons in the family . Common complaints included `` Mrs. Murphy '' leaving her windows open all the time , a fresh air fan , or the family was visiting `` Aunt Minnie '' with the house shut up but they still paid the same rate for oil . As a result of that attitude , others have been discouraged from trying central distribution . A new low capacity meter is the key that unlocks the situation at Oakwood Heights . Called a `` Slo-Flo '' meter it was designed for this job by Power Plus Industries of Los Angeles , a key individual being Don Nelson . Tri-State has acquired its exclusive distribution for the northern , principal heating states . There's an advantage in having a firm like Tri-State headed by a lawyer . The earlier New Haven development was public housing , so it easily leaped over the problems met in a private venture . These have to do with property rights , municipal official attitudes and a host of others . In working out the practical legal conclusions President Waters was not thinking only of this pilot project , for it is planned to duplicate this program or system in other builder developments nationally . It is always difficult , or at least time-consuming , to get approval of any kind of line under a public street , as one example . To overcome this , the builder lays and completes the street himself , then deeds it to the community while retaining a perpetual easement for the oil lines . When a family buys a home the title is subject to a perpetual easement to Tri-State . For the central storage , Tri-State buys one acre , Buries its tanks and simply holds permanent title to that piece . In other words , the whole storage and pipeline system does not belong to the homeowners nor to the town but rather to Tri-State . How does Tri-State get its revenue from this plan ? It leases the whole facility to a large oil company , at least large enough to have a strong credit position . This first test is being leased for ten years but future projects will require at least 15 years . The amount paid by the oil company to Tri-State for the use of its oil distribution system and the privilege of supplying all the homes , is subject to negotiation but naturally must be profitable to both parties . On this first venture the central storage is 20,000 gallons , in two tanks , or an average of 400 gallons for each of the 50 homes . The supplier delivers at his convenience in transport loads , so as to maintain two-to-three weeks reserve supply against weather contingencies . However , that is not all he has to do . He must undertake complete servicing of the oilheating equipment to assure fine heating . In the present project the heating is by circulating hot water from Paragon boiler-burner units with summer-winter domestic hot water hookups . Again , the oil man must read the meters at such intervals as he finds best . For this first development the supplier signing the lease is a major oil company but in turn the deal is being transferred for operation to its local fueloil distributor . The major gets the assured gallonage for the life of the lease and the distributor apparently can do well because delivery cost is low . Initial considerations The officers of the new corporation have naturally explored many angles , as well as personalities that might be affected . For example , the officials of Poughkeepsie town ( township ) where the project is located think highly of it because it simplifies their snow clearing problem . The central storage is near a main artery quite easy to reach with large transports on a short crescent swing , with fewer trucks in the residential streets . The Public Service Commission has ruled that this is not a public utility , subject to their many regulations . Several financial institutions , both banks and insurance companies , have been sounded out . They like it and would supply most of the capital because of the long term leases by strong oil companies . The Government housing agencies consider it feasible with one special stipulation . There must be a restriction in the deed to provide that the customer may not be charged more than the current market price for the oil , an obvious precaution , since the account is permanently wedded , just like with gas or electricity . For a few details of the system the lines are 1-1/4'' '' X-Tru-Coat , a product of Republic Steel Corp. , and all lines are welded . They are laid a minimum of 24'' '' deep and in some areas four feet down , particularly under roads , to stay clear of all other piping such as water and sewers and to minimize shocks from heavy trucking . The meter is mounted high on the basement wall . Its figures are a half inch high and very easy to read , even into tenth gallons . It will accommodate firing rates as low as a half gallon an hour . Ritter , the builder , is convinced that the total cost of all the heating systems plus the oil distribution system is no greater than would be gas heating systems in the houses plus their lines and meters . He believes that this is a sound approach to gas competition in builder developments where gas is available . It would be pretty difficult to install a Tri-State system in old neighborhoods , and that's an understatement . The job of getting property easements and street easements and the acre for the tanks would become pretty discouraging . But in a new development where everything starts from scratch the solutions are simple . Future plans What does Tri-State actually want to do , now that it has the meters under franchise and certain phases of its piping system in the `` patent applied for '' stage ? It wants to interest builders and oil companies in the idea of including its facility in their new home projects , by financing and installing the storage , piping and meters , and leasing these for 15 years , with renewal options , to a strong oil company . It may also work in one other way -- by licensing its system patents and supplying the meters , letting the oil company or even the builder install the facilities . This whole development is certain to be of interest to the readers , for the idea has so often been mentioned , somewhat wistfully . But it's too early yet to go visit Oakwood Heights . Only eight of the 50 houses were completed at the time of the editor's visit on June 8th ; ; others were building . The big tanks were at the site but still sunning themselves . A big mechanical ditcher was running the trenches , and the town building inspector was paying a friendly , if curious , visit . The oilheating industry is looking up , led by a revival of research and development . A primary ingredient in these fields is imagination , and Tri-State Pipeline Corporation deserves a very good mark . Every year about this time National Gargle Your Cooling System week rolls around . It pays in the long ( hot ) run to take good care of the water works . Do it this way for the summer gargle : First , drain that old coolant down the storm sewer . Don't save the anti-freeze , even if it the expensive `` permanent '' type . The word means it won't boil away easily , nothing else . The rust inhibitors in the fluid are used up after one year , and you don't want to risk the rust that two years' use could mean . Pitch it out . If a lot of rust shows in the drain , use a good flushing cleaner . Then fill the system and add a rust inhibitor . Of course , you'll want to use the softest water you can in your radiators . Now , check for leaks in your hoses and hose connections , around the freeze-out plugs , gaskets , water pump seals and heater fittings . Next , run the engine and let it heat up so the thermostat opens , and then look for leaks again . Be sure the bugs and dirt are blown out of the radiator fins . Use the air hose for this job . Check the temperature gage and be sure it is working . If you use one of the new year-round cooling system fluids such as `` Dowguard '' be sure to check it . Dow says that the fluid can be used now for two years . Check its inhibitor effectiveness before leaving it in during the summer . Take precautions now , to be sure you avoid those unpleasant and costly heat breakdowns when the temperature zooms this summer . Don't let your mechanics pull the thermostats out of those fueloil delivery trucks or installation rigs of yours . Spring and summer may be here officially , but those thermos stay in . The fact is that removing and leaving out a thermostat from any water cooled vehicle , will greatly increase the fuel consumption , reduce power and contribute to spark plug fouling due to an accumulation of excessive carbon deposits on the insulators . If you run into excess plug fouling on one truck , check to be sure that the rig has a thermostat . The thermostat is important to get your engine up to operating temperature quickly , and to keep it running at its most efficient temperature through the proper circulation of the coolant . Are you paying too much for your truck insurance ? There's a good chance you are doubling on some coverage , not taking discounts coming to you and not cutting some corners that can be cut . Have a talk with your insurance agent . Be careful that you keep adequate coverage , but look for places to save money . First go over the type of coverage you now have . Look for these features which may mean you can save : Duplicate coverage . Avoid doubling up on the same item . For example , don't pay in a truck policy for medical coverage that you may be paying for in a health and accident policy . Does your policy have a lay-up clause ? This means that if your insured vehicle is laid up for more than 30 days , insurance can be suspended and a proportionate return of your premium made to you . This applies to repair work of winter storage . The figure five is important in insurance . With many company policies you get a fleet discount if you insure five or more rigs . This means either cars or trucks . Discounts run up to 2% of cost . Usually premium reductions can be obtained by applying deductibles to your liability plan . For example : If your bodily injury claims start payment after the first $250 , a 25% premium saving is often made . In the period since the end of World War 2 , -- a period coinciding with merchandising demands for the colorful , the unusual , and the original in signs and displays -- plastics have come on so strong that today they are the acknowledged leaders in the field . The importance of the sign industry to the plastics industry , however , is not in terms of volume alone . Designers of signs and displays have shown a refreshing approach to the adaptation of plastics that has influenced the workings of other industries . Many of today's developments in thermoforming stem from original work done with signs and displays ; ; the art of preprinting in distortion was similarly perfected by the sign makers ; ; and the reverse-surface decorating techniques now used for escutcheons , medallions , etc. , owes much to the field , as does the technology of designing with the light-transmitting properties of the transparent plastics . There is much that many industries can continue to learn from some of the more recent developments described below . The concept of trans-illumination ( as shown by the photo on p. 92 ) , as just one example , offers an entirely new approach to lighting problems -- no matter what industry is involved . A volume market According to a recent Wall Street Journal survey , plastics units now account for more than 50% of all sign sales . Five years ago , they had only 10% of the market , with the remainder firmly entrenched in the stronghold of neon tubing . And it's far from the end for plastics . Industry sources are now estimating that 75% of the signs made during the 1960's will be of plastic construction . Evidence of this trend can best be seen in the recent activities of such leading companies in the field as Advance Neon Sign Co. , Los Angeles , Calif. . Four years ago , the company's entire line was devoted to neon signs ; ; today , 85% is in plastics . From the volume standpoint , the total market represented by the sign industry is impressive . Aggregate sales during 1960 reached approximately $500 million . Currently , there are some 6000 companies in the field , ranging from small firms with a handful of employees to major concerns having complete facilities for production of metal , electrical , and plastic components . Why the trend to plastics ? ? What accounts for the rapid growth of plastics in the sign and display field ? Out of many factors which might be cited , five are most important : 1 . Plastics combine such properties as built-in color , light weight , optional transparency or translucency , resistance to corrosion , as well as the ease of fabrication . 2 . Plastic signs are economical . According to one major producer , materials for a typical plastic sign are approximately 25% less costly than for a comparable neon unit . Shipping cost is also reduced ; ; a 3-by-6-ft. plastic sign weighs about 120 lb. , compared to 275-300 lb. for neon . The weight advantage , plus greater durability of the plastic unit , yields a saving of about one-fifth in shipping . The lighter weight also means less costly supports and mountings are needed . Finally , maintenance costs on plastic signs are much lower than on fragile neon signs . 3 . They offer exceptional design freedom , making it possible to incorporate contours and details which give free range to the talents of the designer . Vacuum- and pressure-formed sheet plastics fill the gap between cardboard and molded plastics . Pre-decoration , low-cost molds , and the freedom to form large and small , thick and thin materials make plastics tailor-made for the industry . 4 . Plastic signs work around the clock . Internal illumination , protected from the elements , gives them powerful visual appeal at night ; ; during daylight hours their brilliant colors command attention and interest . 5 . Advances in equipment and fabrication techniques give the sign or display manufacturer an extremely wide choice of production techniques , ranging from injection molding for intricate , smaller-size , mass-production signs ( generally 5000 units is the minimum ) to vacuum and pressure forming for larger signs of limited runs . Among the newest fabrication methods to enter the display field are expandable styrene molding and blow molding . What plastics to use ? ? For outdoor signs and displays , acrylic , with its outstanding optical characteristics , weather resistance and formability , strongly dominates the picture . At present , both the familiar cast acrylic and the newer extruded sheets are being used by sign manufacturers , with extruded now representing an estimated 10% of the total . ( See panel , p. 166 , for a comparison . ) Of interest is a recent announcement by Du Pont's Polychemicals Dept. of a new methyl methacrylate monomer designated as Monocite H 100 , which was developed specifically for production of cast acrylic sheets for the sign and lighting industry . Sheeting cast from this material reportedly weighs only one-third as much as glass , is impervious to all kinds of weather , and will not yellow . Its high impact strength , even at low temperatures , resists chipping , cracking , and crazing , according to Du Pont . Cellulose acetate butyrate is used extensively for vacuum-formed signs , background panels , and molded or formed letters because of its exceptional toughness , ease of forming , and excellent weathering properties . Its clarity and good optical properties are other important factors . New to the field is a duplex type butyrate laminate in which the two sheets of the laminate are of different color . Thermoforming the laminate and then sanding away the top layer is a quick and economical way to produce a two-color sign . ( see MPl , Mar. 1961 , p. 98 ) . For specialized types of displays , such as large three-dimensional units reproducing a product , package , human or animal figures , etc. , reinforced plastics and rotationally molded vinyl plastisols are other materials frequently used . A relative newcomer in outdoor signs is Mylar polyester film , now used as a printed overlay for trans-illuminated signs ( see below ) . For outdoor signs and displays , where the problem of weathering resistance is no longer a factor , the choice of plastics is almost unlimited . Here may be found regular and impact styrene , cellulose acetate , cellulose butyrate and cellulose propionate , acrylic , vinyl , expandable styrene foam , and polyethylene . The final choice of material depends upon such factors as costs , method of fabrication , degree of complexity , number of units required , time available for tooling , and projected life expectancy of the unit . Often , the finished sign or display incorporates several types of plastics and two or more fabricating techniques . Trans-illuminated billboards One of the most significant advancements in design of plastics signs is the so-called trans-illuminated billboard , now being produced by several large sign manufacturers such as Advance Neon Sign Co. , Los Angeles , and Industrial Electric Inc. , New Orleans , La. . The essential difference between the new trans-illuminated boards and existing billboards is that the former , constructed of translucent plastic panels , are lighted from within . With the source of light behind the copy , there is no loss of lumen output , as with conventional boards illuminated by means of reflected light . Also , the light sources are shielded from dirt and weather exposure and cannot obstruct the view of the sign . The copy itself , including any text or illustrations , is reproduced in full color directly on a thin Mylar polyester film by a photo screen process . The film has an adhesive on the back which permits it to be stripped onto the acrylic panels forming the sign , and also to be stripped off for replacement by new copy as required . Spare sets of face panels simplify the change from one copy or message to another ; ; new panels are exchanged for the old right in the field on a single trip . Panels with outdated copy are returned to the sign shop so a new message can be applied . Signs of this type have already made their appearance in several larger cities , and others are on the way . It is believed that these boards will , within the next few years , replace many of the conventional flood-lighted boards now in use . Trans-illuminated signs also show versatility in other directions . As used by Industrial Electric Inc. , the film panels are printed one at a time , as are 24-sheet posters . Thus the film can be applied to back-lighted translucent plastics faces ; ; they can also be applied to opaque panels for use on cutouts , or they can be applied directly to painted bulletin faces . In this way , the sign maker has an economical means for displaying uniform copy on different sign media . Recently Industrial Electric unveiled another new development made possible by modern plastic materials -- a revolving spectacular sign . Comprised of 16 triangular trans-illuminated plastic sections , it makes it possible to combine three different signs in a single unit . The triangles automatically revolve in a cycle which permits 9 sec. of viewing time for each poster subject . Sixteen panels , each slightly more than 1-1/2 ft. wide , make up the 25-ft. length of the sign . Changeable letters fill many needs Perhaps the best way to indicate the versatility of design that characterizes the use of plastics in signs and displays would be to look at what is happening in only one of the areas in this complex field -- changeable signs . Signs are meant to convey a message , and in most cases , this requires words and letters . Frequently , the message must be changed at intervals to feature new products , price changes , etc. . The huge market for changeable signs has spurred a universal demand for individual plastic letters , in all shapes and sizes -- and a number of companies are set up to supply them . Here are some of the newer items currently available : Poster Products Inc. , Chicago , Ill. : a changeable copy and display sign which consists of an extruded impact styrene background in choice of colors , onto which are mounted snap-in letters , figures , or words screened on acetate or other types of sheet stock . The background , which is available in various widths and continuous lengths , is extruded with parallel undercut grooves which grip the flexible letters securely . The Adaptaplex Co. , Beaverton , Ore. : letters molded of butyrate , available in several sizes in either red or black . Ideal for merchandising use , they are weather-resistant , and have mounting pegs on the back which fit into openings in a vacuum-formed waffle-pattern background panel . For large letters , e.g. thermoformed of acrylic or butyrate , there are other techniques . For example , in a typical store installation , fifty 24-in. and six 36-in. red acrylic letters were mounted against a white painted wood background . The fact that even the larger letters weighed only 5 lb. each made it possible to secure the letters to the building through clear acrylic angle brackets cemented to the letters . Stainless steel screws were used to minimize corrosion stains . For mounting to corrugated plastic backgrounds , very small holes may be drilled in the sides of the letters and stainless steel wire threaded through the openings , its ends twisted behind the panels . Large injection-molded letters are also available for sign installations . Wagner Sign Service Inc. , Chicago , for example , supplies them in several colors , in heights of 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , and 17 inches . They are molded of a special weather-resistant formulation of Tenite butyrate . Also available from this company are Snug-Grip Plasti-Bars , extruded of transparent acrylic material , which may be cemented to any corrugated acrylic background material . Made in lengths from 3 to 10 ft. , the bars are shaped in cross section to provide a secure fit for the tapered slots molded in back of the letters . Still another approach to the changeable letter type of sign is a modular unit introduced by Merritt Products , Azusa , Calif. . This vacuum formed sign is comprised of 27-in. ( or smaller ) panels formed of 0.080-in. clear butyrate sheet stock , masked and sprayed on the rear side . Finished signs are produced by sliding the separate letter panels into channels of 0.025-in. aluminum , which may be mounted to various surfaces . The sheets are extruded of Tenite butyrate by Jet Specialties Co. , Los Angeles , Calif. . On large-area units , where additional structural requirements are imposed , one recent approach utilizes modular extruded or formed channels ( e.g. right-angled corrugations ) of the acrylic or butyrate . Joined side by side , such channels make possible construction of continuous two-dimensional luminous areas up to 50 ft. high and of unlimited width . Letters may be wired to the face of the combined channels , painted on the first surface , or handled in other ways . New rule no. 2 : : Don't build from the outside in -- try to build from the inside out . Don't insert your components into fixed openings , they may or may not fit ; ; position your components before you close them in . For example : Don't wall in your kitchen before you hang the wall cabinets and set the appliances . It's a lot quicker and easier to dimension the kitchen to fit the cabinets and erect the end wall after they are all in place . Set your bathtub before you close in the end of the bathroom . Don't try to wrestle a 400-lb. tub Af through a narrow doorway . Finish your plumbing before you frame it in ( most economical framing is a thin non-bearing partition on either side of the pipes ) . Finish installing and connecting up your furnace and your water heater before you wall them in . There is no better way to waste time than trying to install a furnace in a finished Af closet . Don't position your studs before you insert your windows in conventional construction ; ; that way you may pay more to shim the window into place than you paid for the window . You can save all that shimming time if you set your windows in one , two , three order -- first the stud on one side , then the window , then the stud on the other side . Install your disappearing stair ( or stairs ) to the attic and finish your overhead ducts before you drywall the ceiling . Don't close in your house until everything has been carried in . Last wall Bob Schmitt erects is the wall between the house and garage . That way he can truck his parts right indoors and unload them under the roof . No auto maker would dream of putting the head on the engine before he fitted the pistons in the block . And trailer makers , those most industrialized and therefore most efficient of homebuilders , say they save hundreds of dollars by always building from the inside out . New rule no. 3 : rethink everything to get all the big savings the revolution in materials handling offers you . This revolution is the biggest build-better-for-less news of all , because : 1 . It makes it easy to handle much heavier units , so you can plan to build with much bigger and heavier prefabricated components like those shown in the pictures alongside . 2 . It makes materials handling the only construction cost that ( like earthmoving and roadbuilding ) should be lower today than in 1929 . 3 . It changes the answers to `` Who should do what , and where '' ? It lessens the need for costly on-site fabrication and increases the chance for shop fabrication , where almost everything can be made better and cheaper . 4 . It changes the answers on when to do what at the site . For example , instead of putting in your driveways last ( as many builders do ) you can now save money by putting them in first . Instead of closing the house in first ( as most builders do ) you can now cut your costs by not closing it in until you have to ( see p 121 ) . 5 . It changes the answers on builder-dealer relations . Not so long ago many builders were finding they could cut their costs by `` buying direct '' and short-cutting the dealer . But now many of these same builders are finding they can cut their costs more by teaming up with a dealer who has volume enough to afford the most efficient specialized equipment to deliver everything just where it is needed -- drywall inside the house , siding along the sides , trusses on the walls , roofing on the roof , etc. . Says Clarence Thompson : `` We dealers must earn our mark-up by performing a service for the builder cheaper than he could do it himself '' . The revolution now under way in materials handling makes this much easier . The revolution is well under way , but much more remains to be done . Five years ago a House & Home Round Table cosponsored by the Lumber Dealers' Research Council reported unhappily : `` Only one lumber dealer in ten is equipped to handle unit loads ; ; only one box car in eight has the wide doors needed for unit loads ; ; only one producer in a hundred is equipped to package and ship unit loads ; ; only one builder in a thousand is equipped to receive unit loads . `` So from raw materials to finished erection the costs of materials handling ( most of it inefficient ) add up to one-fourth of the total construction cost of housing '' . `` That House & Home Round Table was the real starting point for today's revolution in materials handling '' , says Clarence Thompson , long chairman of the Lumber Dealers' Research Council . `` It made our whole industry recognize the need for a new kind of teamwork between manufacturer , carrier , equipment maker , dealer , and builder , all working together to cut the cost of materials handling . Before that we lumber dealers were working almost single-handed on the problem '' . Here is where things stand today : 1 . Almost all of the 3,000 lumber dealers who cater primarily to the new-house market and supply 90% of this year's new houses are mechanized . There are few areas left where a builder cannot find a dealer equipped to save him money by delivering everything at lower cost just where his workmen will need it . 2 . Practically all bulky housing products can now be ordered in standard units palletized or unitized for mechanical handling -- including lumber , asphalt shingles , glass block , face brick , plaster , lime , hardboard , gypsum wallboard and sheathing , cement , insulation sheathing , floor tile , acoustical tile , plaster base , and asbestos shingles . 3 . Truck and materials-handling equipment makers now offer specialized units to meet almost every homebuilding need . For some significant new items see the pictures . 4 . More than 50% of all lumber is unitized ; ; an NLRDA survey found that at least 492 lumber mills will strap their shipments for mechanized handling . Of these , 376 said they make no extra charge for strapping in standard units , because they save enough on mechanized carloading to offset their strapping cost . Most of the others will swallow their $.50 to $3 charge rather than lose a good customer . `` With a 15,500-lb. fork-lift , dealers can unload unitized lumber from wide-door box cars for $.30/mbf compared with $1.65 or more to unload loose lumber one piece at a time '' , says James Wright of Aj . 5 . Lumber dealers and lumber manufacturers have agreed on a standard unit for unitized shipments -- 48'' '' wide by a nominal 30'' '' high ( or six McCracken packets 24'' '' wide by nominal 7'' '' high ) . These units make it easy to load as much as 48,000 bd/ft ( say 120,000 lb in a 50' box car ) much more than the average for loose-loaded cars . 6 . The railroads have responded by adding 20,000 more box cars with doors 12' or wider for forklift unloading ( a 21% increase while the total number of box cars was falling 6% ) and by cutting their freight rates twice on lumber shipped in heavily loaded cars . First was a 1958 cut of more than 50% on that portion of the load in excess of 40,000 lb ; ; later came a 1961 cut on the West Coast ( still pending elsewhere ) of $.07/cwt on 70,000 lb-plus carloads ( which works out to more than $4/mbf on that portion of the load in excess of 70,000 lb . 7 . More unitized lumber is being shipped on flat cars , and NLRDA studies show that flat cars loaded with the new Type 6-B floating-load method can be unloaded for as little as $.054/mbf . For long hauls these shipments should be protected with water-proof paper . This costs from $.75 to $2.30/mbf , but the cover can pay off if the lumber is to be stored in the open . These carriers cut handling costs for the dealer -- and the builder . Says NRLDA's James Wright : `` Since 1958 carriers that move material from the yard to the job site have undergone more radical changes than any of the dealer's other equipment '' . The reason : today's components and lumber packages are far too bulky to be handled by a truckdriver and a helper . So manufacturers have pioneered a new type of vehicle -- the self-unloading carrier . It cuts the lumber dealer's cost because it takes only one man -- the driver -- to unload it , and because it unloads in a fraction of the time and at a fraction of the cost of hand unloading . And it helps the builder because it can handle a more efficiently packaged load , can deliver it to the best spot ( in some cases , right on the roof or inside the house ) , and never takes any of the builder's high-priced labor to help unload it . Says Wright : `` Our survey shows that one third of the retail dealers plan to increase the mechanization of their materials handling in the coming two years . And most of the gain will be in self-unloading vehicles '' . New rule no. 4 : : Restudy what your men do , to help them waste less of the time you pay for . Half the manhours you pay for on most jobs are wasted because the job was not planned right , so the right tools were not handy at the right place at the right time , or the right materials were not delivered to the handiest spots or materials were not stacked in the right order for erection , or you bought cheap materials that took too long to fit , or your workmen had to come back twice to finish a job they could have done on one trip . Even `` America's most efficient builder '' , Bob Schmitt of Berea , hopes to cut his labor costs another $2,000 per house as a result of the time-&-motion studies now being completed on his operation by industrial efficiency engineers from the Stanley Works . Already this study has suggested ways to cut his foundation manhours from 170 to 105 by eliminating idle time and wasted motion . Builder Eddie Carr of Washington , past president of NAHB , cut his bricklaying costs $150 a house by adopting the `` SCR masonry process '' worked out after careful time-&-motion studies by the Structural Clay Products Research Foundation to help bricklayers do better work for less . A midwestern builder cut his labor costs per thousand bricks from $81 to $43.50 by adopting this same process , cut them another $7.50 to $36 by buying his bricks in convenient , easy-to-spot 100-brick packages . The SCR process , with its precision corner-posts , its precision guide lines , its working level scaffold , and its hand-level brick supply takes eight manhours to get set , but once ready it makes it easy for bricklayers to lay a thousand bricks a day . See page 156 . One good way to cut your labor waste is to make sure you are using just the right number of men in each crew . Reports Jim Lendrum : `` By studying men on the job , we found that two men -- a carpenter and a helper -- can lay a floor faster than three . We found that three men -- two carpenters and a helper -- can put up wall panels or trusses more economically than four men -- because four men don't make two teams ; ; they make one inefficient three-men-and-a-helper team . We found that wherever you can use two teams on a job , five men , not four , is the magic number '' . No house was ever built that could not have been built better for less if the work had been better planned and the work better scheduled . New rule no. 5 : : Don't waste any $.10-a-minute time on green lumber to save $.03 a stud . This is the most penny-wise , pound-foolish chisel a builder can commit . Green lumber was all very well back in the days of wet plaster , when the framing lumber was bound to swell and then shrink as tons of water dried out the gypsum . But now that all production builders build with drywall and all smart builders build with panels , green lumber is an anachronism you cannot afford . Green studs cost about $.65 ; ; dry studs cost less than $.03 more . So if a green stud makes a carpenter or a drywall finisher or anybody else waste even 20 seconds , the green stud becomes more expensive than a dry stud . There comes a time in the lives of most of us when we want to be alone . Not necessarily to be off all by ourselves , but away from the crowds and common happenstance . If you've travelled in Europe a time or two , it is quite certain that you've had that wanting-to-be-alone feeling or that you will get it on your next visit across the Atlantic . Following a guide , and gratefully so , is an excellent way to see all the important places when everything is strange and new . However , after you've seen all the historical piazzas and plazas , the places and forums , the churches and museums , the palaces and castles , and begin to feel at home in the capitals of Europe , you'll want to change your course and follow the by-roads at will , far from the market places . The champagne at Troyes , the traditional capital of the champagne country , has more ambrosial taste somehow than it has at a sidewalk cafe on the Rue de la Paix or at Tour D'Argent . You can relive history and follow , in fancy , the Crusaders in their quest for the Holy Grail as they sail out from Brindisi , an ancient town in the heel of Italy's boot . And you don't meet the folks from home in Northwest Spain which has remained almost untouched by time and tourists since the Middle Ages . Time stands still as you climb the narrow , stone stairways in tiny villages clinging to steep mountain slopes or wander through story-book towns , perched atop lofty crags , their faces turned to the sea . They've been there since the days of the Moors and the Saracens . And what better way to end a day than by dining with artists and gourmets in a squat but charming fisherman's village on the Mediterranean ? An almost too-simple-to-be-true way to set forth on such adventures is just to put yourself behind the wheel of a car and head for the open road . For those who need or want and can afford another car , buying one and driving it on the grand tour , then shipping it home , is one popular plan for a do-it-yourself pilgrimage . Then , of course , there are those of us who either do not want or need or cannot afford another car . The answer to this diathesis is to pick up a telephone and arrange to rent one . It is that elemental . Almost any travel agent will reserve a car for you . You can call one of the car rental services directly ( Hertz , Avis , Auto-Europe Nationalcar Rental , and others ) and ask them to reserve a car of your choice , and some transportation lines offer this service as well . With few exceptions , your car will be waiting for you at dockside , airport , railroad station or hotel when you arrive , oftentimes at no additional cost . You can wait , of course , until you arrive in Europe before renting your car . The disadvantages to this method are that you may not have as great a choice of models readily available or you may have to wait a few days or , during the busy tourist season , when cars are in great demand , you might find it fairly difficult to get a car at all . Since charges are relatively the same , reserving a car before you leave for Europe will assure you of having one on tap when you want it . For those who plan to travel to Europe by one route and return by another some agencies offer a service whereby you can pick up a car in one city on arrival and leave it in another city , or even another country , when you are ready to return home . At some cities , this pick-up and delivery service is without additional charge , and , if you are budget-wise , when you are planning your itinerary , you will take advantage of these free delivery and collection stations in major cities within the larger European countries . International Touring Documents are usually provided with the car as are road maps and touring data . A valid American driving license is accepted in all countries except Portugal , Spain , Yugoslavia and Eastern Europe . If you plan to visit any of these countries , you can obtain your International Driving Permit before you leave at a nominal fee -- around $3.00 . Your insurance , too , with most agencies , is provided with the car , covering comprehensive fire , theft , liability and collision with a deductible clause which varies in different countries . If you would feel happier with full collision insurance , there is a small additional charge , again varying from country to country and depending on the term of such insurance . The average charge for this additional insurance coverage is roughly $1.00 a day . The charge is variable , however , and goes as low as $.50 a day in Ireland and as high as $2.00 a day in Greece . Rental fees are variable , too , throughout the countries of Europe . There are as many rates as there are countries and models of cars available . As in the United States , there is a flat fee-per-day rental charge plus a few cents per kilometer driven , and the per-day rate drops if the car is retained for a week . It drops again after fifteen and/or twenty-one days . It is well to bear in mind that gasoline will cost from $.80 to $.90 for the equivalent of a United States gallon and while you might prefer a familiar Ford , Chevrolet or even a Cadillac , which are available in some countries , it is probably wiser to choose the smaller European makes which average thirty , thirty-five and even forty miles to the gallon . Your choice of model will undoubtedly be governed by the number of people travelling in your group . With the exception of the sports cars , even the quite tiny sedans will seat four passengers if you are willing to sacrifice comfort and luggage space for really economical transportation . There is a large variety of models to choose from in most countries , however , including 6-passenger sedans and station wagons and the rental fee isn't all that much greater than for the wee sedans . The basic costs are generally pretty much the same regardless of the agency through which you reserve your car , but some of them offer supplementary advantages . There is the free intra-city `` rent it here , leave it there '' service , as an example , the free delivery and collection at the airport , dockside or your hotel , luggage racks , touring documents and information and other similar services . A little investigation by telephone or reading the travel ads in the newspapers and magazines will give you these pertinent details on the additional money-saving benefits . The investigation will be well worth your time . All model cars are not available in all countries . Quite naturally , there is a greater availability of those models which are manufactured within a specific country . If you would like to start your tour in Italy , where the rental fees are actually the lowest in Europe , Fiats in all sizes are available , as are Alfa Romeo Giulietta models . If you wish to budget closely on transportation , saving your extra dollars to indulge in luxuries , one agency lists the small Fiat 500 at only $1.26 a day plus $.03 a kilometer and the Fiat 2100 Station Wagon , seating six , at just $1.10 a day and $.105 a kilometer . If you will be using your car more than fifteen days , which isn't all unlikely , the daily rates drop quite sharply to $.86 a day for the Fiat 500 and to an infinitesimal $.30 a day for the Fiat 2100 Station Wagon . With six in the group , the cost comes to just a nickel a day per person on the daily fee . In the majority of countries , however , the rates range from $3.00 to $3.50 a day for the smaller sedans and graduate up to $7.00 and $8.00 a day for the larger , luxury European models , with the rate per kilometer driven starting at $.03 and going up as high as $.12 . The same model car might be available in six or eight countries , yet not two countries will have the same rate either for the daily rate or rate per kilometer driven . The variations are not too great . Rates for American cars are somewhat higher , ranging from about $8.00 a day up to $14.00 a day for a Chevrolet Convertible , but the rate per kilometer driven is roughly the same as for the larger European models . Rates in Greece and Finland are fairly high , actually the highest in Europe , and , surprisingly enough , they are also quite high in Ireland . If you are planning to tour Europe for longer than a month , it might be wise for you to lease a car . The actual over-all cost , for the first month , will perhaps not be too much lower than the rental charges for the same period of time , but you will receive a new car . You will be entitled to all the advantages of a new car owner , which includes the factory guarantee and the services valid at authorized dealers throughout Europe . Further , there is no mileage charge or mileage limitations when you lease a car , and you pay only the flat monthly rate plus a nominal charge for documents and insurance since the car is registered and insured individually for your trip . There is a fairly wide selection of models of English , German and French manufacture from which you can choose from the very small Austin 7 , Citroen 2 CV , Volkswagens , Renaults to the 6-passenger Simca Beaulieu . Leasing a car is not as common or as popular as renting a car in Europe , but for long periods it will be unquestionably more economical and satisfactory . After the first month , rates are considerably less , averaging only about $60 a month for most 4- and 5-passenger models . There are reasons for some people not wanting to rent cars and going on the do-it-yourself plan . For one thing , the driver usually sees less and has less fun than his passengers since it becomes pretty necessary for him to keep at least one eye on the road . Then , too , European drivers have reputations for being somewhat crazy on the road and some Americans are not particularly keen on getting mixed up with them . Still there is a way for those who want to see some of the back country of Europe by car . The way is to rent a chauffeur-driven car . It isn't as expensive as most people believe it to be . Your chauffeur's expenses will average between $7.00 to $12.00 a day , but this charge is the same whether you rent a 7-passenger Cadillac limousine or a 4-passenger Peugeot or Fiat 1800 . The big spread is in the charge for each kilometer driven , being governed by the rate at which gasoline is consumed . Since most European cars average more miles per gallon of gasoline than American cars , it naturally follows that the cost per kilometer for these models will be less , but the greater seating capacity of the large American cars will equalize this , provided your group is sufficiently large to fill a 7-passenger limousine . The fees for the rental of chauffeur-driven cars vary in the different countries in the same manner as they do for the drive-yourself cars . However , whether you arrange to have a European or American model , if you rent a car with the proper seating capacity in relation to the number of people in your party , your transportation expense will average very close to $10.00 per day per passenger . This will include your helpful , English-speaking chauffeur and a drive of an average of 150 kilometers in any one day . If you drive greater distances than that , you'll just be skimming the surface and will never discover the enchantment , fascination and beauty which lured you in the first place to explore the hinterlands . Of course , if you want to throw all caution to the winds and rent an Imperial or Cadillac limousine just for you and your bride , you'll have a memorable tour , but it won't be cheap , and it is not recommended unless you own a producing oil well or you've had a winner in the Irish Sweepstakes . In American romance , almost nothing rates higher than what the movie men have called `` meeting cute '' -- that is , boy-meets-girl seems more adorable if it doesn't take place in an atmosphere of correct and acute boredom . Just about the most enthralling real-life example of meeting cute is the Charles MacArthur-Helen Hayes saga : reputedly all he did was give her a handful of peanuts , but he said simultaneously , `` I wish they were emeralds '' . Aside from the comico-romantico content here , a good linguist-anthropologist could readily pick up a few other facts , especially if he had a little more of the conversation to go on . The way MacArthur said his line -- if you had the recorded transcript of a professional linguist -- would probably have gone like this : Af Primary stresses on emeralds and wish ; ; note pitch 3 ( pretty high ) on emeralds but with a slight degree of drawl , one degree of oversoftness . Conclusions : The people involved ( and subsequent facts bear me out here ) knew clearly the relative values of peanuts and emeralds , both monetary and sentimental . And the drawling , oversoft voice of flirtation , though fairly overt , was still well within the prescribed gambit of their culture . In other words , like automation machines designed to work in tandem , they shared the same programming , a mutual understanding not only of English words , but of the four stresses , pitches , and junctures that can change their meaning from black to white . At this point , unfortunately , romance becomes a regrettably small part of the picture ; ; but consider , if you can bear it , what might have happened if MacArthur , for some perverse , undaunted reason , had made the same remark to an Eskimo girl in Eskimo . To her peanuts and emeralds would have been just so much blubber . The point -- quite simply -- is this : words they might have had ; ; but communication , no . This basic principle , the first in a richly knotted bundle , was conveyed to me by Dr. Henry Lee Smith , Jr. , at the University of Buffalo , where he heads the world's first department of anthropology and linguistics . A brisk , amusing man , apparently constructed on an ingenious system of spring-joints attuned to the same peppery rhythm as his mind , Smith began his academic career teaching speech to Barnard girls -- a project considerably enlivened by his devotion to a recording about `` a young rat named Arthur , who never could make up his mind '' . Later , he became one of the central spirits of the Army Language Program and the language school of Washington's Foreign Service Institute . It was there , in the course of trying to prepare new men for the `` culture shock '' they might encounter in remote overseas posts , that he first began to develop a system of charting the `` norms of human communication '' . To the trained ear of the linguist , talk has always revealed a staggering quantity of information about the talker -- such things as geographical origin and/or history , socio-economic identity , education . It is only fairly recently , however , that linguists have developed a systematic way of charting voices on paper in a way that tells even more about the speakers and about the success or failure of human communication between two people . This , for obvious reasons , makes their techniques superbly useful in studying the psychiatric interview , so useful , in fact , that they have been successfully used to suggest ways to speed diagnosis and to evaluate the progress of therapy . In the early 1950's , Smith , together with his distinguished colleague , George Trager ( so austerely academic he sometimes fights his own evident charm ) , and a third man with the engaging name of Birdwhistell ( Ray ) , agreed on some basic premises about the three-part process that makes communication : ( 1 ) words or language ( 2 ) paralanguage , a set of phenomena including laughing , weeping , voice breaks , and `` tone '' of voice , and ( 3 ) kinesics , the technical name for gestures , facial expressions , and body shifts -- nodding or shaking the head , `` talking '' with one's hands , et cetera . Smith's first workout with stresses , pitches , and junctures was based on mother , which spells , in our culture , a good deal more than bread alone . For example , if you are a reasonably well-adjusted person , there are certain ways that are reasonable and appropriate for addressing your mother . The usual U.S. norm would be : Af Middle pitches , slight pause ( juncture ) before mother , slight rise at the end . The symbols of mother's status , here , are all usual for culture U.S.A. . Quite other feelings are evidenced by this style : Af Note the drop to pitch 1 ( the lowest ) on mother with no rise at the end of the sentence ; ; this is a `` fade '' ending , and what you have here is a downtalking style of speech , expressing something less than conventional respect for mother . Even less regard for mom and mom's apple pie goes with : Af In other words , the way the speaker relates to mother is clearly indicated . And while the meaning of the words is not in this instance altered , the quality of communication in both the second and third examples is definitely impaired . An accompanying record of paralanguage factors for the second example might also note a throaty rasp . With this seven-word sentence -- though the speaker undoubtedly thought he was dealing only with the subject of food -- he was telling things about himself and , in the last two examples , revealing that he had departed from the customs of his culture . The joint investigations of linguistics and psychiatry have established , in point of fact , that no matter what the subject of conversation is or what words are involved , it is impossible for people to talk at all without telling over and over again what sort of people they are and how they relate to the rest of the world . Since interviewing is the basic therapeutic and diagnostic instrument of modern psychiatry , the recording of interviews for playbacks and study has been a boost of Redstone proportions in new research and training . Some of the earliest recordings , made in the 1940's demonstrated that psychiatrists reacted immediately to anger and anxiety in the sound track , whereas written records of the same interview offered far fewer cues to therapy which -- if they were at all discernible in print -- were picked up only by the most skilled and sensitive experts . In a general way , psychiatrists were able to establish on a wide basis what many of them had always felt -- that the most telling cues in psychotherapy are acoustic , that such things as stress and nagging are transmitted by sound alone and not necessarily by words . At a minimum , recording -- usually on tape , which is now in wide professional use -- brings the psychiatric interview alive so that the full range of emotion and meaning can be explored repeatedly by the therapist or by a battery of therapists . Newest to this high-powered battery are the experts in linguistics who have carried that minimum to a new level . By adding a systematic analysis with symbols to the typed transcripts of interviews , they have supplied a new set of techniques for the therapist . Linguistic charting of the transcribed interview flags points where the patient's voice departs from expected norms . It flags such possible breakdowns of communication as rehearsed dialogue , the note of disapproval , ambivalence or ambiguity , annoyance , resentment , and the disinclination to speak at all -- this last often marked by a fade-in beginning of sentences . Interpretation , naturally , remains the role of the therapist , but orientation -- not only the patient's vocal giveaways of geographical and socio-economic background , but also vocal but non-verbal giveaways of danger spots in his relationship to people -- can be considerably beefed up by the linguist . His esoteric chartings of the voice alert the therapist to areas where deeper probing may bring to light underlying psychological difficulties , making them apparent first to the therapist and eventually to the patient . In one now-historic first interview , for example , the transcript ( reproduced from the book , The First Five Minutes ) goes like this : The therapist's level tone is bland and neutral -- he has , for example , avoided stressing `` you '' , which would imply disapproval ; ; or surprise , which would set the patient apart from other people . The patient , on the other hand , is far from neutral ; ; aside from her specifically regional accent , she reveals by the use of the triad , `` irritable , tense , depressed '' , a certain pedantic itemization that indicates she has some familiarity with literary or scientific language ( i.e. , she must have had at least a high-school education ) , and she is telling a story she has mentally rehearsed some time before . Then she catapults into `` everything and everybody '' , putting particular violence on `` everybody '' , indicating to the linguist that this is a spot to flag -- that is , it is not congruent to the patient's general style of speech up to this point . Consequently , it is referred to the therapist for attention . He may then very well conclude that `` everybody '' is probably not the true target of her resentment . Immediately thereafter , the patient fractures her rehearsed story , veering into an oversoft , breathy , sloppily articulated , `` I don't feel like talking right now '' . Within the first five minutes of this interview it is apparent to the therapist that `` everybody '' truthfully refers to the woman's husband . She says later , but still within the opening five minutes , `` I keep thinking of a divorce but that's another emotional death '' . The linguistic and paralinguistic signals of misery are all present in the voice chart for this sentence ; ; so are certain signals that she does not accept divorce . By saying `` another emotional death '' , she reveals that there has been a previous one , although she has not described it in words . This the therapist may pursue in later questioning . The phrase , `` emotional death '' , interesting and , to a non-scientific mind , rather touching , suggests that this woman may have some flair for words , perhaps even something of the temperament regrettably called `` creative '' . Since the psychiatric interview , like any other interview , depends on communication , it is significant to note that the therapist in this interview was a man of marked skill and long experience . His own communication apparatus operated superbly , and Lillian Ross readers will note instantly its total lack of resemblance to the blunted , monumentally unmeshed mechanism of Dr. Blauberman . Interestingly enough -- although none of the real-life therapists involved could conceivably compare with Blauberman -- when groups of them began playing back interviews , they discovered any number of ways in which they wanted to polish their own interview techniques ; ; almost everyone , on first hearing one of his own sessions on tape , expressed some desire to take the whole thing over again . Yet , in spite of this , intensive study of the taped interviews by teams of psychotherapists and linguists laid bare the surprising fact that , in the first five minutes of an initial interview , the patient often reveals as many as a dozen times just what's wrong with him ; ; to spot these giveaways the therapist must know either intuitively or scientifically how to listen . Naturally , the patient does not say , `` I hate my father '' , or `` Sibling rivalry is what bugs me '' . What he does do is give himself away by communicating information over and above the words involved . Some of the classic indicators , as described by Drs. Pittenger , Hockett , and Danehy in The First Five Minutes , are these : ambiguity of pronouns : Stammering or repetition of I , you , he , she , et cetera may signal ambiguity or uncertainty . On the other hand significant facts may be concealed -- she may mean I or everybody , as it did with the tense and irritable woman mentioned before , may refer to a specific person . The word that is not used can be as important as the word that is used ; ; therapist and/or linguist must always consider the alternatives . When someone says , for example , `` They took x-rays to see that there was nothing wrong with me '' , it pays to consider how this statement would normally be made . ( This patient , in actuality , was a neurasthenic who had almost come to the point of accepting the fact that it was not her soma but her psyche that was the cause of her difficulty . ) Amateur linguists note here that Pursewarden , in Durrell's Alexandria Quartet , stammered when he spoke of his wife , which is hardly surprising in view of their disastrous relationship . She was just another freighter from the States , and she seemed as commonplace as her name . She was the John Harvey , one of those Atlantic sea-horses that had sailed to Bari to bring beans , bombs , and bullets to the U.S. Fifteenth Air Force , to Field Marshal Montgomery's Eighth Army then racing up the calf of the boot of Italy in that early December of 1943 . The John Harvey arrived in Bari , a port on the Adriatic , on November 28th , making for Porto Nuovo , which , as the name indicates , was the ancient city's new and modern harbor . Hardly anyone ashore marked her as she anchored stern-to off Berth 29 on the mole . If anyone thought of the John Harvey , it was to observe that she was straddled by a pair of ships heavily laden with high explosive and if they were hit the John Harvey would likely be blown up with her own ammo and whatever else it was that she carried . Which was poison gas . It had required the approval of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt before the John Harvey could be loaded with 100 tons of mustard gas and despatched to the Italian warfront . For in a world as yet unacquainted with the horrors of the mushroom cloud , poison gas was still regarded as the ultimate in hideous weapons . Throughout the early years of World War 2 , , reports persisted that the Axis powers had used gas -- Germany in Russia , Japan in China again . They were always denied . Influential people in America were warning the Pentagon to be prepared against desperation gas attacks by the Germans in future campaigns . Some extremists went so far as to urge our using it first . To silence extremists , to warn the Axis , President Roosevelt issued this statement for the Allies in August : `` From time to time since the present war began there have been reports that one or more of the Axis powers were seriously contemplating use of poisonous gas or noxious gases or other inhumane devices of warfare . I have been loath to believe that any nation , even our present enemies , could or would be willing to loose upon mankind such terrible and inhumane weapons . `` However , evidence that the Axis powers are making significant preparations indicative of such an intention is being reported with increasing frequency from a variety of sources . `` Use of such weapons has been outlawed by the general opinion of civilized mankind . This country has not used them , and I hope that we never will be compelled to use them . I state categorically that we shall under no circumstances resort to the use of such weapons unless they are first used by our enemies '' . The following month the invasion of Italy was begun , and Roosevelt gave effect to his warning by consenting to the stockpiling of poison gas in southern Italy . Bari was chosen as a depot , not only for its seeming safety , but because of its proximity to airfields . Any retaliatory gas attack would be airborne . It would be made in three waves -- the first to lay down a smokescreen , the second to drop the gas bombs , the third to shower incendiaries which would burn everything below . So the vile cargo went into the hole of the John Harvey . A detachment of six men from the 701st Chemical Maintenance Company under First Lt. Howard D. Beckstrom went aboard , followed by Lt. Thomas H. Richardson , the Cargo Security Officer . Secrecy was paramount . Only a few other people -- very important people -- knew of the nitrogen-mustard eggs nestled below decks . No one else must know . Thus , in the immemorial way -- in the way of the right hand that knows and the left that does not -- was the stage set for tragedy at Bari . It was the night of December 2 , 1943 , and it was growing dark in Bari . It was getting on toward 7 o'clock and the German Me-210 plane had been and gone on its eighth straight visit . Capt. A. B. Jenks of the Office of Harbor Defense was very worried . He knew that German long-range bombers had been returning to the attack in Italy . On November 24th , they had made a raid on La Maddalena . Two days later , some 30 of them had struck at a convoy off Bougie , sinking a troopship -- and it had been that very night that the Me-210 had made its first appearance . After it had reappeared the next two nights , Jenks went to higher headquarters and said : `` For three days now a German reconnaissance plane has been over the city taking pictures . They're just waiting for the proper time to come over here and dump this place into the Adriatic '' . But the older and wiser heads had dismissed his warning as alarmist . Even though it was known that the Luftwaffe in the north was now being directed by the young and energetic General Peltz , the commander who would conduct the `` Little Blitz '' on London in 1944 , a major raid on Bari at this juncture of the war was not to be considered seriously . True , there had been raids on Naples -- but Naples was pretty far north on the opposite coast . No , Bari was out of range . More than that , Allied air had complete superiority in the Eighth Army's sector . So Captain Jenks returned to his harbor post to watch the scouting plane put in five more appearances , and to feel the certainty of this dread rising within him . For Jenks knew that Bari's defenses were made of paper . The Royal Air Force had but a single light anti-aircraft squadron and two balloon units available . There were no R.A.F. fighter squadrons on Bari airfield . The radar station with the best location was still not serviceable . Telephone communication was bad . And everywhere in evidence among the few remaining defensive units was that old handmaiden of disaster -- multiple command . It had been made shockingly evident that very morning to Ensign Kay K. Vesole , in charge of the armed guard aboard the John Bascom . A British officer had come aboard and told him that in case of enemy air attack he was not to open fire until bombs were actually dropped . Then he was to co-ordinate his fire with a radar-controlled shore gun firing white tracers . `` This harbor is a bomber's paradise '' , the Britisher had said with frank grimness . `` It's up to you to protect yourselves . We can't expect any help from the fighters at Foggia , either . They're all being used on offensive missions '' . Vesole had been stunned . Not fire until the bombs came down ! He thought of the tons and tons of flammable fluid beneath his feet and shook his head . Like hell ! Like hell he'd wait -- and supposing the radar-controlled gun got knocked out ? What would his guns guide on then -- the North Star ? Ensign Vesole decided that he would not tarry until he heard the whispering of the bombs , and when night began to fall , he put Seaman 2/c Donald L. Norton and Seaman 1/c William A. Rochford on the guns and told them to start shooting the moment they saw an enemy silhouette . Below decks , Seaman 1/c Stanley Bishop had begun to write a letter home . Above decks on the John Harvey , Lieutenant Richardson gazed at the lights still burning on the port wall and felt uneasy . There were lights glinting in the city , too , even though it was now dark enough for a few stars to become visible . Bari was asking for it , he thought . For five days now , they had been in port and that filthy stuff was still in the hold . Richardson wondered when it would be unloaded . He hoped they would put in somewhere way , way down in the earth . The burden of his secret was pressing down on him , as it was on Lieutenant Beckstrom and his six enlisted men . Lieutenant Richardson could envy the officers and men of the John Harvey in their innocent assumption that the ship contained nothing more dangerous than high explosive bombs . They seemed happy at the delay in unloading , glad at the chance to go ashore in a lively liberty port such as Bari . Nine of them had gone down the gangplank already . Deck Cadet James L. Cahill and Seaman Walter Brooks had been the first to leave . Richardson had returned their departing grins with the noncommittal nod that is the security officer's stock in trade . The other half of the crew , plus Beckstrom and his men , had remained aboard . Richardson glanced to sea and started slightly . Damned if that wasn't a sailing ship standing out of the old harbor -- Porto Vecchio . The night was so clear that Richardson had no difficulty making out the silhouette . Then the thought of a cloudless sky made him shiver , and he glanced upward . His eyes boggled . It was a clear night and it was raining ! Capt. Michael A. Musmanno , Military governor of the Sorrentine Peninsula , had also seen and felt the `` rain '' . But he had mistaken it for bugs . Captain Musmanno's renovated schooner with the flamboyant name Unsinkable had just left Porto Vecchio with a cargo of badly-needed olive oil for the Sorrentine's civilian population . Musmanno was on deck . At exactly 7:30 , he felt a fluttering object brush his face . He snatched at it savagely . He turned the beam of his flashlight on it . He laughed . It was the silver foil from the chocolate bar he had been eating . He frowned . But how could -- ? Another , longer strip of tinsel whipped his mouth . It was two feet long . It was not candy wrapping . It was `` window '' -- the tinsel paper dropped by bombers to jam radar sets , to fill the scope with hundreds of blips that would seem to be approaching bombers . `` Fermate '' ! Musmanno bellowed to his Italian crewmen . `` Stop ! Stop the engines '' ! Unsinkable slowed and stopped , hundreds of brilliant white flares swayed eerily down from the black , the air raid sirens ashore rose in a keening shriek , the anti-aircraft guns coughed and chattered -- and above it all motors roared and the bombs came whispering and wailing and crashing down among the ships at anchor at Bari . They had come from airports in the Balkans , these hundred-odd Junkers 88's . They had winged over the Adriatic , they had taken Bari by complete surprise and now they were battering her , attacking with deadly skill . They had ruined the radar warning system with their window , they had made themselves invisible above their flares . And they also had the lights of the city , the port wall lanterns , and a shore crane's spotlight to guide on . After the first two were blacked out , the third light was abandoned by a terrified Italian crew , who left their light to shine for nine minutes like an unerring homing beacon until British MP's shot it out . In that interval , the German bombers made a hell of Bari harbor . Merchant ships illuminated in the light of the flares , made to seem like stones imbedded in a lake of polished mud , were impossible to miss . The little Unsinkable sank almost immediately . Captain Musmanno roared at his men to lash three of the casks of olive oil together for a raft . They got it over the side and clambered aboard only a few minutes before their schooner went under . John Bascom went down early , too . Ensign Vesole and his gunners had fought valiantly , but they had no targets . Most of the Junkers were above the blinding light of the flares , and the radar-controlled shore gun had been knocked out by one of the first sticks of bombs . Vesole rushed from gun to gun , attempting to direct fire . He was wounded , but fought on . Norton and Rochford fired wildly at the sounds of the motors . Bishop rushed on deck to grab a 20-mm gun , pumping out 400 rounds before sticks of three bombs each crashed into Holds One , Three and Five . Now the Bascom was mortally wounded . Luckily , she was not completely aflame and would go down before the gasoline could erupt . The order to abandon ship was given , but cries of pain could be heard from the wounded below decks . There is a pause in the merriment as your friends gaze at you , wondering why you are staring , open-mouthed in amazement . You explain , `` I have the strangest feeling of having lived through this very same event before . I can't tell when , but I'm positive I witnessed this same scene of this particular gathering at some time in the past '' ! This experience will have happened to many of you . Emerson , in his lecture , refers to the `` startling experience which almost every person confesses in daylight , that particular passages of conversation and action have occurred to him in the same order before , whether dreaming or waking , a suspicion that they have been with precisely these persons in precisely this room , and heard precisely this dialogue , at some former hour , they know not when '' . Most psychiatrists dismiss these instances of that weird feeling as the deja vue ( already seen ) illusion , just as they dismiss dream previsions as coincidences . In this manner they side-step the seemingly hopeless investigation of the greater depths of mystery in which all of us grope continually . When a man recognizes a certain experience as the exact pattern of a previous dream , we have an instance of deja vue , except for the fact that he knows just why the experience seems familiar . Occasionally there are examples of pre-vision which cannot be pushed aside without confessing an unscientific attitude . One day Maeterlinck , coming with a friend upon an event which he recognized as the exact pattern of a previous dream , detailed the ensuing occurrences in advance so accurately that his companion was completely mystified . Rudyard Kipling's scorn for the `` jargon '' of psychical research was altered somewhat when he wondered `` how , or why , had I been shown an unreleased roll of my life film '' ? The famous author tells us of the strange incident in Something About Myself . One day when he attended a war memorial ceremony in Westminster Abbey his view was obstructed by a stout man on his left , his attention turned to the irregular pattern of the rough slab flooring and someone , clasping him by the arm , whispered , `` I want a word with you , please '' . At that moment Kipling was overwhelmed with awed amazement , suddenly recalling that these identical details of scene , action and word had occurred to him in a dream six weeks earlier . Freud probably contributed more than anyone else to the understanding of dreams , enabling us to recognize their equivalents in our wakeful thoughts . However , readers who accept Freud's findings and believe that he has solved completely the mystery of dreams , should ponder over the following words in his Interpretation Of Dreams , Chapter 1 : : As `` a matter of fact no such complete solution of the dream has ever been accomplished in any case , , and what is more , every one attempting such solution has found that in most cases there have remained a great many components of the dream the source of which he has been unable to explain nor is the discussion closed on the subject of the mantic or prophetic power of dreams '' . Dreams present many mysteries of telepathy , clairvoyance , prevision and retrovision . The basic mystery of dreams , which embraces all the others and challenges us from even the most common typical dream , is in the fact that they are original , visual continuities . I recall the startling , vivid realism of a dream in which I lived through the horror of the bombing of a little Korean town . I am sure that nothing within me is capable of composing that life-like sequence , so complete in detail , from the hodge-podge of news pictures I have seen . And when psychology explains glibly , `` but the subconscious mind is able to produce it '' it refers to a mental region so vaguely identified that it may embrace the entire universal mind as conceivably as part of the individual mind . Skeptics may deny the more startling phenomena of dreams as things they have never personally observed , but failure to wonder at their basic mystery is outright avoidance of routine evidence . The question becomes , `` What is a dream '' ? Is a dream simply a mental or cerebral movie ? Every dream , and this is true of a mental image of any type even though it may be readily interpreted into its equivalent of wakeful thought , is a psychic phenomenon for which no explanation is available . In most cases we recognize certain words , persons , animals or objects . But these are dreamed in original action , in some particular continuity which we don't remember having seen in real life . For instance , the dreamer sees himself seated behind neighbor Smith and , with photographic realism , sees Smith driving the car ; ; whereas , it is a matter of fact that Smith cannot drive a car . There is nothing to suggest that the brain can alter past impressions to fit into an original , realistic and unbroken continuity like we experience in dreams . The entire concept of cerebral imagery as the physical basis of a mental image can find no logical support . A `` mental image '' subconsciously impressing us from beneath its language symbols in wakeful thought , or consciously in light sleep , is actually not an image at all but is comprised of realities , viewed not in the concurrent sensory stream , but within the depths of the fourth dimension . Dreams that display events of the future with photographic detail call for a theory explaining their basic mystery and all its components , including that weird feeling of deja vue , inevitably fantastic though that theory must seem . As in the theory of perception , established in psycho-physiology , the eye is recognized as an integral part of the brain . But then this theory confesses that it is completely at a loss as to how the image can possibly be received by the brain . The opening paragraph of the chapter titled The Theory Of Representative Perception , in the book Philosophies Of Science by Albert G. Ramsperger says , `` passed on to the brain , and there , by some unexplained process , it causes the mind to have a perception '' . But why is it necessary to reproduce the retinal image within the brain ? As retinal images are conceded to be an integral function of the brain it seems logical to suppose that the nerves , between the inner brain and the eyes , carry the direct drive for cooperation from the various brain centers -- rather than to theorize on the transmission of an image which is already in required location . Hereby , the external object viewed by the eyes remains the thing that is seen , not the retinal image , the purpose of which would be to achieve perceptive cooperation by stirring sympathetic impulses in the other sensory centers , motor tensions , associated word symbols , and consciousness . Modern physics has developed the theory that all matter consists of minute waves of energy . We know that the number of radio and television impulses , sound waves , ultra-violet rays , etc. , that may occupy the very same space , each solitary upon its own frequency , is infinite . So we may conceive the coexistence of the infinite number of universal , apparently momentary states of matter , successive one after another in consciousness , but permanent each on its own basic phase of the progressive frequencies . This theory makes it possible for any event throughout eternity to be continuously available at any moment to consciousness . Space in any form is completely measured by the three dimensions . If the fourth dimension is a physical concept and not purely metaphysical , through what medium does it extend ? It is not through space nor time that the time machine most approved by science fiction must travel for a visit to the permanent prehistoric past , or the ever-existent past-fantasy future . Three seconds flat is the usual time , and the space is crossed by moderate mileage , while the overwhelming immensity of such journeys must be conceived as a static pulsation through an enormous number of coexistent frequencies which perpetuate all events . The body , senses and brain , in common with all matter , have their counterpart on each of a countless number of frequencies . The senses in each counterpart bear the impression only of phenomena that share its own frequency , whereas those upon all other frequencies are invisible , inaudible and intactible to them . Consciousness is the factor that provides the progressive continuity to sensory impressions . When consciousness deserts the sleeping body and the wakeful world , it continues in the myriad progressions of the ever-present past and future , in a life as vibrant and real as the one left when the body tired and required sleep . If the photographically realistic continuity of dreams , however bizarre their combinations , denies that it is purely a composition of the brain , it must be compounded from views of diverse realities , although some of them may never be encountered in what we are pleased to call the real life . Dr. H. V. Hilprecht , Professor of Assyrian at the University of Pennsylvania , dreamed that a Babylonian priest , associated with the king Kurigalzu , ( 1300 B.C. ) escorted him to the treasure chamber of the temple of Bel , gave him six novel points of information about a certain broken relic , and corrected an error in its identification . As a matter of fact , the incorrect classification , the result of many weeks of labor by Dr. Hilprecht , was about to be published by him the following day . Some time later the missing part of the relic was found and the complete inscription , together with other new evidence , fully corroborated the ancient priest's information . Dr. Hilprecht was uncertain as to the language used by the ancient priest in his dream . He was almost positive it was not Assyrian nor Cassite , and imagined it must have been German or English . We may conclude that all six points of information , ostensibly given by the dream priest , could have been furnished by Dr. Hilprecht's subconscious reasoning . But , in denying any physical reality for this dream , how could the brain possibly compose that realistic , vividly visual continuity uninterrupted by misty fadeout , violent break or sudden substitution ? Which theory is more fantastic : 1 . That the perfect continuity was composed from the joblot of memory impressions in the professor's brain , or 2 . That the dream was a reality on the infinite progressions of universal , gradient frequencies , across which the modern professor and the priest of ancient Nippur met ? The degree of circumstance , the ratio of memory to forgetfulness , determines whether a dream will be a recognized , fulfilled prevision , or the vaguely , effective source of the weird deja vue feeling . No doubt some experiences vanish so completely as to leave no trace on the sleeper's mind . Probably less than one percent of our previsions escape final obliteration before we wake . When we arrive at the events concerned in the vanished majority , they , of course , cannot impress us as anything familiar . Nevertheless , there are notably frequent instances of deja vue , in which our recognition of an entirely novel event is a feeling of having lived through it before , a feeling which , though vague , withstands the verbal barrage from the most impressive corps of psychologists . If deja vue is an illusion , then peculiarly , it is a most prevalent mental disturbance affecting even the most level-headed people . Chauncey Depew , one-time runner-up for the Republican Presidential nomination , was attending a convention at Saratoga , where he was scheduled to nominate Colonel Theodore Roosevelt for Governor of New York when he noticed that the temporary chairman was a man he had never met . After the preliminary business affair was finished Depew arose and delivered the convincing speech that clinched the nomination for Roosevelt . If Depew had told any academic psychologist that he had a weird feeling of having lived through that identical convention session at some time in the past , he would have been informed that he was a victim of deja vue . But the famous orator felt more than vague recognition for the scene . He remembered exactly when he had lived through it before , and he had something to prove he had . One week before the convention , Depew was seated on the porch of a country home on the Hudson , gazing at the opposite shore . `` The food is wonderful and it is a lot of fun to be here '' ! So wrote a ten year old student in a letter to his parents from North Country School , Lake Placid , New York . In this one sentence , he unwittingly revealed the basic philosophy of the nutrition and psychological programs in operation at the school . Because the food is selected with thought for its nutritional value , care for its origin , and prepared in a manner that retains the most nutrients , the food does taste good . When served in a psychological atmosphere that allows young bodies to assimilate the greatest good from what they eat because they are free from tension , a foundation is laid for a high level of health that releases the children from physical handicaps to participate with enjoyment in the work assignments , the athletic programs and the most important phase , the educational opportunities . Situated in a region of some of the loveliest mountain scenery in the country , the school buildings are located amid open fields and farm lands . These contemporary structures , beautifully adapted to a school in the country , are home to 60 children , ages eight to fourteen , grades four through eight . From fourteen states and three foreign countries they come to spend the months from mid-September to June . The Director , Walter E. Clark , believes that a school with children living full time in its care must take full responsibility for their welfare . To him this means caring for the whole child , providing basic nutrition , and a spiritual attitude that lends freedom for the development of the mind . Improved farming methods The concept of good nutrition really began with the garden . The school has always maintained a farm to supply the needs of the school . In a climate hostile to agriculture , Mr. Clark has had to keep alert to the most productive farm techniques . Where a growing season may , with luck , allow 60 days without frost , and where the soil is poor , sandy , quick-drying and subject to erosion , many farmers fail . Throughout the Adirondack region abandoned farm homes and wild orchards bear ghostly testimony that their owners met defeat . Mr. Clark found that orthodox procedures of deep plowing , use of chemical fertilizers and insecticides , plus the application of conservation principles of rotation and contouring , did not prevent sheet erosion in the potato fields and depreciation of the soil . `` To give up these notions required a revolution in thought '' , Mr. Clark said in reminiscing about the abrupt changes in ideas he experienced when he began reading `` Organic Gardening '' And `` Modern Nutrition '' in a search for help with his problems . `` Louis Bromfield's writings excited me as a conservationist '' . By 1952 he was convinced he would no longer spray . He locked his equipment in a cabinet where it still remains . After reading `` Plowman's Folly '' by Edward H. Faulkner , he stopped plowing . The basis for compost materials already existed on the school farm with a stable of animals for the riding program , poultry for eggs , pigs to eat garbage , a beef herd and wastes of all kinds . Separate pails were kept in the kitchen for coffee grounds and egg shells . All these materials and supplementary manure and other fertilizers from neighboring dairy and poultry farms made over 40 tons of finished compost a year . It was applied with a compost shredder made from a converted manure spreader . Years of patient application of compost and leaf mulching has changed the structure of the soil and its water-holding capacity . Soon after the method changed , visitors began asking how he managed to irrigate his soil to keep it looking moist , when in reality , it was the soil treatment alone that accomplished this . To demonstrate the soil of his vegetable gardens as it is today , Mr. Clark stooped to scoop up a handful of rich dark earth . Sniffing its sweet smell and letting it fall to show its good crumbly consistency , he pointed to the nearby driveway and said , `` This soil used to be like that hard packed road over there '' . `` People and soils respond slowly '' , says Walter Clark , `` but the time has now come when the gardens produce delicious long-keeping vegetables due to this enrichment program . No chemical fertilizers and poisonous insecticides and fungicides are used '' . The garden supplies enough carrots , turnips , rutabagas , potatoes , beets , cabbage and squash to store for winter meals in the root cellar . The carrots sometimes don't make it through the winter ; ; the cabbage and squash keep until March or April . There is never enough corn , peas or strawberries . Mr. Clark still has to use rotenone with potatoes grown on the least fertile fields , but he has watched the insect damage decrease steadily and hopes that continued use of compost and leaf mulch will allow him to do without it in the future . A new project planned is the use of Bio-Dynamic Starter . New ideas for improving nutrition came with the study of soil treatment . `` After the soil , the kitchen '' , says Mr. Clark . The first major change was that of providing wholewheat bread instead of white bread . `` Adults take a long time to convince and you are thwarted if you try to push '' . At first the kitchen help was tolerant , but ordered their own supply of white bread for themselves . `` You can't make French toast with whole-wheat bread '' , was an early complaint . Of course they learned in time that they not only could use whole-wheat bread , but the children liked it better . Homemade bread Mrs. Clark , as house manager , planned the menus and cared for the ordering . Then Miss Lillian Colman came from Vermont to be kitchen manager . Today whole grains are freshly ground every day and baked into bread . Mr. Clark's studies taught him that the only way to conserve the vitamins in the whole grain was prompt use of the flour . Once the grains are ground , vitamin E begins to deteriorate immediately and half of it is lost by oxidation and exposure to the air within one week . A mill stands in a room off the kitchen . Surrounding it are metal cans of grains ordered from organic farms in the state . Miss Colman pours measures of whole wheat , oats , and soy beans and turns on the motor . She goes on about her work and listens for the completion of the grinding . The bread baked from this mixture is light in color and fragrant in aroma . It is well liked by the children and faculty . There is one problem with the bread . `` Lillian's bread is so good and everything tastes so much better here that it is hard not to eat too much '' , said the secretary ruefully eyeing her extra pounds . Hot , freshly-ground cereal The school has not used cold prepared cereals for years , though at one time that was all they ever served . When the chance came , they first eliminated cold cereal once a week , then gradually converted to hot fresh-ground cereal every day . They serve cracked wheat , oats or cornmeal . Occasionally , the children find steamed , whole-wheat grains for cereal which they call `` buckshot '' . At the beginning of the school year , the new students don't eat the cereal right away , but within a short time they are eating it voraciously . When they leave for vacations they miss the hot cereal . The school has received letters from parents asking , `` What happened to Johnny ? He never used to like any hot cereal , now that's the only kind he wants . Where can we get this cereal he likes so much '' ? Body-building foods Salads are served at least once a day . Vegetables are served liberally . Most come from the root cellar or from the freezer . Home-made sauerkraut is served once a week . Sprouted grains and seeds are used in salads and dishes such as chop suey . Sometimes sprouted wheat is added to bread and causes the children to remark , `` Lillian , did you put nuts in the bread today '' ? Milk appears twice a day . The school raises enough poultry , pigs , and beef cattle for most of their needs . Lots of cheese made from June grass milk is served . Hens are kept on the range and roosters are kept with them for their fertility . Organ meats such as beef and chicken liver , tongue and heart are planned once a week . Also , salt water fish is on the table once a week . For deserts , puddings and pies are each served once a week . Most other desserts are fruit in some form , fresh fruits once daily at least , sometimes at snack time . Dried fruits are purchased from sources where they are neither sulphured nor sprayed . Apples come from a farm in Vermont where they are not sprayed . Oranges and grapefruit are shipped from Florida weekly from an organic farm . Finding sources for these high quality foods is a problem . Sometimes the solution comes in unexpected ways . Following a talk by Mr. Clark at the New York State Natural Food Associates Convention , a man from the audience offered to ship his unsprayed apples to the school from Vermont . Wheat-germ , brewer's yeast and ground kelp are used in bread and in dishes such as spaghetti sauce , meat loaves . Miss Colman hopes to find suitable shakers so that kelp can be available at the tables . Raw wheat-germ is available on the breakfast table for the children to help themselves . Very few fried foods are used and the use of salt and pepper is discouraged . Drinking with meals is also discouraged ; ; pitchers of water merely appear on the tables . Nothing is peeled . The source is known so there is no necessity to remove insecticide residues . The cooking conserves a maximum of the vitamin C content of vegetables by methods which use very little water and cook in the shortest time possible . Wholesome snacks , no candy Since Mr. Clark believes firmly that the chewing of hard foods helps develop healthy gums and teeth , raw vegetables and raw whole-wheat grains are handed out with fresh fruit and whole-wheat cookies at snack time in the afternoons . To solve the problem of the wheat grains spilling on the floor and getting underfoot , a ball of maple syrup boiled to candy consistency was invented to hold the grains . On their frequent hikes into the nearby mountains , the children carry whole grains to munch along the trail . They learn to like these so well that it isn't surprising to hear that one boy tried the oats he was feeding his horse at chore time . They tasted good to him , so he brought some to breakfast to eat in his cereal bowl with milk and honey . Maple syrup is made by the children in the woods on the school grounds . This and raw sugar replace ordinary refined sugar on the tables and very little sugar is used in cooking . Candy is not allowed . Parents are asked in the bulletin to send packages of treats consisting of fruit and nuts , but no candy . Nourishing meals Mr. Clark believes in a good full breakfast of fruit , hot cereal , milk , honey , whole-wheat toast with real butter and eggs . The heavy meal comes in the middle of the day . Soup is often the important dish at supper . Homemade of meat , bones and vegetables , it is rich in dissolved minerals and vitamins . The school finds that the children are satisfied with smaller amounts of food since all of it is high in quality . The cost to feed one person is just under one dollar a day . Outdoor exercises Even before he saw the necessity of growing better food and planning good nutrition , Mr. Clark felt the school had a good health program . Rugged outdoor exercise for an hour and a half every day in all kinds of weather was the rule . A vigorous program existed in skiing , skating sports and overnight hiking . Healthier children Since the change to better nutrition , he feels he can report on improvements in health , though he considers the following statements observations and not scientific proof . Visitors to the school ask what shampoo they use on the children's hair to bring out the sheen . The ruddy complexion of the faces also brings comment . Buffeted by swirling winds , the little green biplane struggled northward between the mountains beyond Northfield Gulf . Wires whined as a cold November blast rocked the silver wings , but the engine roar was reassuring to the pilot bundled in the open cockpit . He peered ahead and grinned as the railroad tracks came into view again below . `` Good old iron compass '' ! He thought . A plume of smoke rose from a Central Vermont locomotive which idled behind a string of gravel cars , and little figures that were workmen labored to set the ruptured roadbed to rights . The girders of a shattered Dog River bridge lay strewn for half a mile downstream . Vermont's main railroad line was prostrate . And in the dark days after the Great Flood of 1927 -- the worst natural disaster in the state's history -- the little plane was its sole replacement in carrying the United States mails . Rain of near cloudburst proportions had fallen for three full days and it was still raining on the morning of Friday , November 4 , 1927 , when officials of the Post Office Department's Railway Mail Service realized that their distribution system for Vermont had been almost totally destroyed overnight . Clerks and postmasters shoveled muck out of their offices -- those who still had offices -- and wondered how to move the mail . The state's railroad system counted miles of broken bridges and missing rights-of-way : it would obviously remain out of commission for weeks . And once medicine , food , clothing and shelter had been provided for the flood's victims , communications and the mail were the next top problems . From Burlington , outgoing mail could be ferried across Lake Champlain to the railroad at Port Kent , N. Y. . But what came in was piling up . The nearest undisrupted end of track from Boston was at Concord , N. H. . When Governor Al Smith offered New York National Guard planes to fly the mail in and out of the state , it seemed a likely temporary solution , easing Burlington's bottleneck and that at Montpelier too . The question was `` Where to land '' ? There was no such thing as an airport in Vermont . Burlington aviator John J. Burns suggested the parade ground southwest of Fort Ethan Allen , and soon a dozen hastily-summoned National Guard pilots were bringing their wide-winged `` Jenny '' and DeHaviland two-seaters to rest on the frozen sod of the military base . The only available field that could be used near flood-ravaged Montpelier was on the Towne farm off upper Main Street , a narrow hillside where takeoffs and landings could be safely made only under light wind conditions . Over in Barre the streets had been deep in swirling water , and bridges were crumpled and gone . Anticipating delivery of medicines and yeast by plane , Granite City citizens formed an airfield committee and with the aid of quarrymen and the 172nd Infantry , Vermont National Guard , laid out runways on Wilson flat , high on Millstone Hill . The `` Barre Aviation Field '' was set to receive its first aircraft the Sunday following the flood . Though the makeshift airports were ready , the York State Guard flyers proved unable to keep any kind of mail schedule . They had courage but their meager training consisted of weekend hops in good weather , in and out of established airports , And the increasingly cold weather soon raised hob with the water cooled engines of their World War 1 , planes . It seemed like a good time for officials to use a recently-passed law empowering the post office department to contract for the transport of first class mail by air . They had to act fast , for letters were clogging the terminals . Down in Concord , New Hampshire , was a flier in the right place at the right time : Robert S. Fogg , a native New Englander , had been a World War 1 , flying instructor , barnstormer , and one of the original planners of the Concord Airport . Tall , wiry , dark-haired Bob Fogg had already racked up one historical first in air mail history . Piloting a Curtiss Navy MF flying boat off Lake Winnipesaukee in 1925 , he had inaugurated the original Rural Delivery air service in America . During the excitement following Lindbergh's flight to Paris earlier in 1927 , dare devil aviators overnight became legendary heroes . In Concord , Bob Fogg was the most prominent New Hampshire boy with wings . Public-spirited backers staked him to a brand-new airplane , aimed at putting their city and state on the flying map . The ship was a Waco biplane , one of the first two of its type to be fitted with the air cooled , 225/hp Wright radial engine known as the Whirlwind . A trim green and silver-painted craft only 22-1/2 feet long , the Waco was entered to compete in the `` On-to-Spokane '' Air Derby of 1927 . As a matter of fact , Fogg and his plane didn't get beyond Pennsylvania in the race -- an engine oil leak forced him down -- but the flying service and school he started subsequently were first steps in paying off his wry-faced backers . So with all this experience , Bob Fogg was a natural choice to receive the first Emergency Air Mail Star Route contract . His work began just six days after the flood . By airline from Concord to Burlington is a distance of about 150 miles , counting a slight deviation for the stop at either Barre or Montpelier . The first few days Bob Fogg set his plane down on Towne field back of the State House when the wind was right , and used Wilson flat above Barre when it wasn't . Between the unsafe Towne field and the long roundabout back road haul that was necessary to gain access to Wilson flat , arrangements at the state capital were far from satisfactory . Each time in , the unhappy pilot , pushing his luck , begged the postal officials that met him to find a safer landing place , preferably on the flat-topped hills across the Winooski River . `` But Fogg '' , they countered , `` we can't get over there . And besides you seem to make it all right here '' . It took a tragedy to bring things to a head . After a week of precarious uphill landings and downwind takeoffs , Fogg one day looked down at the shattered yellow wreckage of an Army plane strewn across snow-covered Towne field . Sent to Montpelier by Secretary Herbert Hoover , Red Cross Aide Reuben Sleight had been killed , and his pilot , Lt. Franklin Wolfe , badly injured . With the field a blur of white the unfortunate pilot had simply flown into the hillside . Faced with this situation , Postmaster Charles F. McKenna of Montpelier went with Fogg on a Burlington trip , and together they scouted the terrain on the heights of Berlin . A long flat known as the St. John field seemed to answer their purpose , and since the Winooski bridges were at last passable , they decided to use it . With a wary eye on the farmer's bull , Fred Somers of Montpelier and Mr. St. John marked the field with a red table cloth . As a wind direction indicator , they tied a cotton rag to a sapling . With these aids , and a pair of skiis substituting for wheels on the Waco , Bob Fogg made the first landing on what is now part of the Barre-Montpelier Airport on November 21 , 1927 . Each trip saw the front cockpit filled higher with mail pouches . During the second week of operations , Fogg received a telegram from the Post Office Department , asking him to `` put on two airplanes and make two flights daily , plus one Sunday trip '' . Since Fogg's was a one-man , one-plane flying service , this meant that he would have to do both trips , flying alone 600 miles a day , under sub-freezing temperature conditions . Over the weeks , America's first Star Route Air Mail settled into a routine pattern despite the vagaries of weather and the lack of ground facilities and aids to navigation . Each morning at five Fogg crawled out of bed to bundle into flying togs over the furnace register of his home . Always troubled by poor circulation in his feet , he experimented with various combinations of socks and shoes before finally adopting old-style felt farmer's boots with his sheepskin flying boots pulled over them . A sheep-lined leather flying suit , plus helmet , goggles and mittens completed his attire for the rigors of the open cockpit . The airman's stock answer to `` Weren't you cold '' ? Became `` Yes , the first half hour is tough , but by then I'm so numb I don't notice it '' ! As daylight began to show through the frosty windows , Fogg would place a call to William A. Shaw at the U. S. Weather Station at Northfield , Vermont , for temperature and wind-velocity readings . Shaw could also give the flyer a pretty good idea of area visibility by a visual check of the mountains to be seen from his station . `` Ceilings '' were judged by comparison with known mountain heights and cloud positions . Later on in the day Fogg could get a better weather picture from the Burlington Weather Bureau supervised by Frank E. Hartwell . Out at the airport each morning , Fogg's skilled mechanic Caleb Marston would have the Waco warmed up and running in the drafty hangar . ( He'd get the engine oil flowing with an electric heater under a big canvas cover . ) Wishing to show that aviation was dependable and here to stay , Bob Fogg always made a point of taking off each morning on the dot of seven , disregarding rain , snow and sleet in true postal tradition . Concord learned to set its clocks by the rackety bark of the Whirlwind's exhaust overhead . Sometimes the pilot had to turn back if fully blocked by fog , but 85% of his trips were completed . Plane radios were not yet available , and once in the air , Fogg flew his ship by compass , a good memory for landmarks as seen from above , and a capacity for dead reckoning and quick computation . Often , threading through the overcast , he was forced to fly close to the ground by a low ceiling , skimming above the Winooski or the White River along the line of the broken railroad . When driving rain or mist socked in one valley , Fogg would chandelle up and over to reverse course and try another one , ranging from the Ottauquechee up to Danville in search of safe passage through the mountain passes . The dependable Wright engine was never stopped on these trips . It ticked over smoothly , idling while Fogg exchanged mails with the armed messenger from Burlington at Fort Ethan Allen , and one from Montpelier and Barre at the St. John field . Sometimes , on a return trip , the aviator would `` go upstairs '' high over the clouds . There he'd take a compass reading , figure his air speed , and deduce that in a certain number of minutes he'd be over the broad meadows of the Merrimack Valley where it would be safe to let down through the overcast and see the ground before it hit him . Bob Fogg didn't have today's advantages of Instrument Flight and Ground Control Approach systems . At the end of the calculated time he'd nose the Waco down through the cloud bank and hope to break through where some feature of the winter landscape would be recognizable . Usually back in Concord by noon , there was just time to get partially thawed out , refuel , and grab a bit of Mrs. Fogg's hot broth before starting the second trip . Day after day Fogg shuttled back and forth on his one-man air mail route , until the farmers in their snowy barnyards and the road repairmen came to recognize the stubby plane as their link with the rest of the country . The flyer had his share of near-misses . At Fort Ethan Allen the ever-present wind off Lake Champlain could readily flip a puny man-made thing like an airplane if the pilot miscalculated . Once the soldiers from the barracks had to hold the ship from blowing away while Fogg revved the engine and got the tail up . At a nod of his head they let go , turning to cup their ears against the icy slipstream . Tracks in the snow showed the plane was airborne in less than a hundred feet . One afternoon during a cold , powdery snowstorm , Fogg took off for Concord from the St. John field . Are you retiring now ? If so , are you saying , `` Where did the last few years go ? How did I get to be sixty-five so fast ? What do I do now '' ? Yes , retirement seems to creep upon you suddenly . Somehow we old-timers never figured we would ever retire . We always thought we would die with our boots on . Out of the blue comes talk of pension plans . Compulsory retirement at sixty-five looms on our horizon . Still , it seems in the far future . Suddenly , one day , up it pops ! Sixty-five years and you've had it ! So , now what ? Oh sure ! You've thought about it before in a hazy sort of way . But ! It never seemed real ; ; never seemed as if it could happen to you ; ; only to the other fellow . Now ! Here it is ! How am I going to live ? What am I going to do ? Where do I go from here ? A great many retired people are the so-called white collar workers . Are you one of these ? If so , you are of the old school . You are conscientious , hard working , honest , accurate , a good penman , and a stickler for a job well done , with no loose ends . Everything must balance to the last penny . Also you can spell , without consulting a dictionary for every other word . You never are late for work and seldom absent . Actually , you can take no special credit for this . It is the way you were taught and your way of life . All this is standard equipment for a man of your day ; ; your stock in trade ; ; your livelihood . However , the last few years of your life , things seem to be changing . Your way doesn't seem to be so darned important any more . You realize you are getting in the old fogy class . To put it bluntly , you are getting out-moded . What's happened ? The answer is a new era . Now , looming on the horizon are such things as estimated totals , calculated risks and I.B.M. machines . The Planning Dept. comes into existence . All sorts of plans come to life . This is followed by a boom in conferences . Yes sir ! Conferences become very popular . When a plan burst its seams , hasty conferences supply the necessary patch , and life goes merrily on . That's called progress ! The new way of life ! Let's face it ! You had your day and it was a good day . Let this generation have theirs . Time marches on ! Well , to get back to the problem of retirement . Every retiring person has a different situation facing him . Some have plenty of money -- some have very little money . Some are blest with an abundance of good health -- some are in poor health and many are invalids . Some have lovely homes -- some live in small apartments . Some have beautiful gardens -- some not even a blade of grass . Some have serenity of mind , the ability to accept what they have , and make the most of it ( a wonderful gift to have , believe me ) -- some see only darkness , the bitter side of everything . Well , whatever you have , that's it ! You've got to learn to live with it . Now ! The question is `` How are you going to live with it '' ? You can sit back and moan and bewail your lot . Yes ! You can do this . But , if you do , your life will be just one thing -- unhappiness -- complete and unabridged . It seems to me , the first thing you've got to do , to be happy , is to face up to your problems , no matter what they may be . Make up your mind to pool your resources and get the most out of your remaining years of life . One thing , I am sure of , you must get an interest in life . You've got to do something . Many of you will say , `` Well , what can I do '' ? Believe me ! There are many , many things to do . Find out what you like to do most and really give it a whirl . If you can't think of a thing to do , try something -- anything . Maybe you will surprise yourself . True ! We are not all great artists . I , frankly , can't draw a straight line . Maybe you are not that gifted either , but how about puttering around with the old paints ? You may amaze yourself and acquire a real knack for it . Anyway , I'll bet you have a lot of fun . Do you like to sew ? Does making your own clothes or even doll clothes , interest you ? Do you love to run up a hem , sew on buttons , make neat buttonholes ? If you do , go to it . There is always a market for this line of work . Some women can sit and sew , crochet , tat or knit by the hour , and look calm and relaxed and turn out beautiful work . Where sewing is concerned , I'm a total loss . When you see a needle in my hands you will know the family buttons have fallen off and I have to sew them back on , or get out the safety pins . Then again , there's always that lovely old pastime of hooking or braiding rugs . Not for me , but perhaps just the thing for you . Well ! How's about mosaic tile , ceramics or similar arts and crafts ? Some people love to crack tile and it's amazing what beautiful designs they come up with as a result of their cracking good time . How about the art of cooking ? Do you yearn to make cakes and pies , or special cookies and candies ? There is always an open market for this sort of delicacy , in spite of low calorie diets , cottage cheese and hands-off-all-sweets to the contrary . Some people can carve most anything out of a piece of wood . Some make beautiful chairs , cabinets , chests , doll houses , etc. . Perhaps you couldn't do that but have you ever tried to see what you could do with a hunk of wood ? Outside of cutting your fingers , maybe you would come up with nothing at all , but then again , you might turn out some dandy little gadgets . Some women get a real thrill out of housework . They love to dust , scrub , polish , wax floors , move the furniture around from place to place , take down the curtains , put up new ones and have themselves a real ball . Maybe that's your forte . It certainly isn't mine . I can look at furniture in one spot year in and year out and really feel for sure that's where it belongs . Perhaps you would like to become a writer . This gives you a wide and varied choice . Will it be short stories , fiction , nonfiction , biography , poetry , children's stories , or even a book if you are really ambitious ? Ever since I was a child , I have always had a yen to try my hand at writing . If you do decide to write , you will soon become acquainted with rejection slips and dejection . Don't be discouraged ! This is just being a normal writer . Just let the rejection slips fall where they may , and keep on plugging , and finally you will make the grade . Few new writers have their first story accepted , so they tell me . But , it could happen , and it may happen to you . Then there's always hobbies , collecting stamps , coins , timetables , salt and pepper shakers , elephants , dogs , dolls , shells , or shall we just say collecting anything your heart desires ? I can hear some of you folks protesting . You say , `` But it costs a lot of money to have a hobby . I haven't got that kind of money '' . True ! It does cost a lot of money for most hobbies but there are hobbies that are for free . How about a rock collection , or a collection of leaves from different trees or shrubs and in different colors ? Then , take flowers . They are many and varied . Also , there's scrap books , collecting newspaper pictures and clippings , or any items of interest to you . It's getting interested in something that counts . As for me , I am holding in reserve two huge puzzles ( I love puzzles ) to put together when time hangs heavy on my hands . So far , the covers have never been off the boxes . I just don't have time to do half the things I want to do now . So in closing , fellow retired members , I advise you to make the most of each day , enjoy each one to the n'th degree . Travel , if you can . Keep occupied to the point you are not bored with life and you will truly find these final days and years of your lives to be sunshine sweet . Good Luck ! To one and all -- Good Days ahead ! An important criterion of maturity is creativity . The mature person is creative . What does it mean to be creative , a term we hear with increasing frequency these days ? When we turn to Noah Webster we find him helpful as usual . `` To be creative is to have the ability to cause to exist -- to produce where nothing was before -- to bring forth an original production of human intelligence or power '' . We are creative , it seems , when we produce something which has not previously existed . Thus creativity may run all the way from making a cake , building a chicken coop , or producing a book , to founding a business , creating a League of Nations or , developing a mature character . All living creatures from the lowest form of insect or animal life evidence the power of creativity , if it is only to reproduce a form like their own . While man shares this procreative function with all his predecessors in the evolutionary process , he is the only animal with a true non-instinctive and conscious creative ability . An animal , bird or insect creates either a burrow , or nest or hive in unending sameness according to specie . Man's great superiority over these evolutionary forbears is in the development of his imagination . This gives him the power to form in his mind new image combinations of old memories , ideas and experiences and to project them outside of himself into his environment in new and ever-changing forms . It has been truly said that anything man can imagine he can produce or create by projecting this inner image into its counterpart in the objective world . In our own time we have seen the most fantastic imagery of a Jules Verne come into actuality . The vision of a Lord Tennyson expressed in a poem 100 years ago took visible form over London in the air blitzes of 1941 . In fact all of our civilized world is the resultant of man's projection of his imagination over the past 60 centuries or more . It is in this one aspect , at least , that man seems to be made in the image of his Creator . Not only can man project his imagination out into his environment in concrete forms , but even more importantly , he can turn it inward to help create new and better forms of himself . We recognize that young people through imaginative mind and body training can become athletes , acrobats , dancers , musicians and artists , developing many potentialities . We know that actors can learn to portray a wide variety of character roles . By this same combination of the will and the imagination , each one of us can learn to portray permanently the kind of character we would like to be . We must realize with Prof. Charles Morris in his The Open Self that `` Man is the being that can continually remake himself , the artisan that is himself the material for his own creation '' . So far in history man has been too greatly over-occupied with projecting things into his environment rather than first creating the sort of person who can make the highest use of the things he has created . Is not the present world crisis a race between things we have created which can now destroy us and between populations of sufficient wisdom and character to forestall the tragedy . Is it not the obligation of us older citizens to lend our weight to being creative on the character side and to hasten our own maturing process ? Sir Julian Huxley in his book Uniqueness Of Man makes the novel point that just as man is unique in being the only animal which requires a long period of infancy and childhood under family protection , so is he the only animal who has a long period after the decline of his procreativity . Some recent writings assume that the ignorant young couples are a thing of the remote , Victorian past ; ; that nowadays all honeymooners are thoroughly familiar with the best sex-manuals and know enough from talk with friends and personal experimentation to take all the anxiety and hazards out of the situation . Perhaps -- but extensive discussions with contemporary practitioners , family doctors and gynecologists indicate that this is still an area of enormous ignorance . Joking and talking may be freer and easier , but the important factual information is still lacking for far too many newly-married men and women . Various factors in the setting can still be of great advantage in making the first intercourse a good rather than a bad memory for one or both . Privacy must be highly assured both in time and place . That is , locking the room or stateroom door gives privacy of location , but it is equally important to be sure there is time enough for an utterly unhurried fulfillment . If the wedding party lasted late , and the travel schedule means there are only a few hours before resuming the trip or making an early start , the husband may forestall tensions and uncertainties by confiding to his bride that lying in each other's arms will be bliss enough for these few hours . The consummation should come at the next stopping place when they have a long private time ( day or night ) for that purpose . First intercourse for the bride brings with it the various problems connected with virginity and the hymen . One thing should be clear to both husband and wife -- neither pain nor profuse bleeding has to occur when the hymen is ruptured during the first sex act . Ignorance on this point has caused a great deal of needless anxiety , misunderstanding and suspicion . The hymen is , in essence , a fragile membrane that more or less completely covers the entrance to the vagina in most female human beings who have not had sex relations . ( Hymen , in fact , is the Greek word for membrane . ) Often it is thin and fragile and gives way readily to the male organ at the first attempt at intercourse . As might be expected , girls in this situation bleed very little and perhaps not at all in the process of losing their virginity . It is also important to realize that many girls are born without a hymen or at most only a tiny trace of one ; ; so that the absence of the hymen is by no means positive proof that a girl has had sex relations . But there is a basis in fact for the exaggerations of the folk-lore beliefs . Some hymens are so strongly developed that they cannot be torn without considerable pain to the girl and marked loss of blood . More rarely , the hymen is so sturdy that it does not yield to penetration . Extreme cases are on record in which the doctor has had to use instruments to cut through the hymen to permit marital relations to be consummated . These cases , for all their rarity , are so dramatic that friends and relations repeat the story until the general population may get an entirely false notion of how often the hymen is a serious problem to newly-weds . In recent times , when sexual matters began to be discussed more scientifically and more openly , the emotional aspects of virginity received considerable attention . Obviously , the bridal pair has many adjustments to make to their new situation . Is it necessary to add to the other tensions the hazard of making the loving husband the one who brought pain to his bride ? Gynecologists and marriage manuals began to advise that the bride should consult a physician before marriage . If he foresaw any problem because of the quality of the hymen , it was recommended that simple procedures be undertaken at once to incise the hymen or , preferably , to dilate it . As a natural outgrowth of this approach it was often suggested that the doctor should complete the preparation for painless intercourse by dilating the vagina . This recommendation was based on the fact that the hymen was not the only barrier to smooth consummation of the sex act . The vagina is an organ capable of remarkable contraction and dilation . This is obvious when it is remembered that , during childbirth , the vagina must dilate enough to permit the passage of the baby . The intricate system of muscles that manage the contraction and dilatation of the vagina are partly under voluntary control . But an instinctive reflex may work against the conscious intention of the woman . That is , when first penetration takes place , the pressure and pain signals may involuntarily cause all the vaginal muscles to contract in an effort to bar the intrusion and prevent further pain . The advantages of dilatation by the physician are both physical and psychological . Since it is a purely professional situation , none of the pain is associated with love-making or the beloved . By using instruments of gradually increasing size , the vagina is gently , and with minimum pain at each stage , taught to yield to an object of the appropriate shape . In this process the vaginal muscles come under better conscious control by the girl . She learns how to relax them to accept -- instead of contracting them to repel -- the entering object . Apart from the standard problem of controlling the vaginal muscles , other serious barriers may exist that need special gynecological treatment . It is far better to have such conditions treated in advance than to have them show up on the honeymoon where they can create a really serious situation . When no medical problems exist , the newly married couple generally prefer to cope with the adjustments of their new relationship by themselves . Special information and guidance about the possible difficulties are still of great value . Folk-lore , superstition and remembered passages from erotic literature can create physical and emotional problems if blindly taken as scientific facts and useful hints . The importance of loving tenderness is obvious . The long , unhurried approach and the deliberate prolongation of fore-play work on several levels . Under the excitement of caresses and sexual stimulation the vagina relaxes and dilates and the local moisture greatly increases , providing an excellent lubricant to help achieve an easier penetration . Extensive observations by physicians during vaginal examinations have established the fact that a single finger inserted along the anterior wall ( the top line of the vagina as the woman lies on her back ) may cause a great deal of distress in a virgin . But during the same examination , two fingers may be inserted along the posterior wall ( the bottom of the vagina in the same position ) without any pain ; ; and in fact without any difficulty if the pressure is kept downward at all times . These regional differences of sensitivity to pain may be of crucial significance during the earliest intercourse . The husband and wife should start with this anatomical information clearly in mind . They may then adjust their positions and movements to avoid too much pressure on the urethra and the anterior wall of the vagina ; ; at least until repeated intercourse has dilated it and pain is no longer a possible threat against the full pleasure of love-making . In fact , the technical procedure in medical examinations may be wisely adapted to his romantic purposes by the husband during the honeymoon . Locker-room talk often stresses the idea that a man is doing the girl a favor if he is forceful and ruthless during the first penetration . The false reasoning is that a gradual advance prolongs the pain while a swift powerful act gets it over with and leaves the girl pleased with his virility and grateful for his decisiveness in settling the problem once and for all . Such talk is seriously in error . Ruthlessness at this time can be a very severe shock to the bride , both physically and psychologically . The insistent , forceful penetration may tear and inflame the vaginal walls as well as do excessive damage to the hymen . The pain and distress associated with the performance may easily give the wife a deep-seated dread of marital relations and cause her , unconsciously , to make the sex act unpleasant and difficult for both by exercising her vaginal muscles to complicate his penetration instead of relaxing them to facilitate it . Serious attention must also be given to the husband's problems in the honeymoon situation . The necessity for keeping alert to his bride's hazards can act as an interference with the man's spontaneous desire . The emotional stimulation may be so great that he may experience a premature climax . This is a very common experience and should in no way discourage or dishearten either husband or wife . Or the frequent need to check and discipline himself to the wisest pace of the consummation can put him off stride and make it impossible for him to be continuously ready for penetration over a long period . The signals to proceed may therefore come when he is momentarily not able to take advantage of them . The best course is to recover his physical excitement by a change of pace that makes him ardent again . This may require imagination and reminding himself that now he can be demanding and self-centered . He can take security from the fact that the progress he has made by his gentle approach will not be lost . Now while he uses talk , caresses or requires caresses from her , his bride will sympathetically understand the situation and eagerly help him restore his physical situation so they can have the consummation they both so eagerly desire . A final word . The accumulated information on this point shows that first intercourse , even when it is achieved with minimum pain or difficulty , is seldom an overwhelming sexual experience to a woman . Too many new things are happening for it to be a complete erotic fulfillment . Only under rare circumstances would a bride experience an orgasm during her first intercourse . Both man and wife should be aware of the fact that a lack of climax , and even the absence of the anticipated keen pleasure are not a sign that the wife may be cold or frigid . If the early approaches are wise , understanding and patient , the satisfactions of marital fulfillment will probably be discovered before the marriage is much older . Writing in a large volume on the nude in painting and sculptures , titled The Nude : A Study In Ideal Form , Kenneth Clark declares : `` The human body , as a nucleus , is rich in associations . It is ourselves and arouses memories of all the things we wish to do with ourselves '' . Perhaps this is a clue to the amazing variety and power of reactions , attitudes , and emotions precipitated by the nude form . The wide divergence of reactions is clearly illustrated in the Kinsey studies in human sexuality . Differences were related to social , economic , and educational backgrounds . Whereas persons of eighth grade education or less were more apt to avoid or be shocked by nudity , those educated beyond the eighth grade increasingly welcomed and approved nudity in sexual relations . Such understanding helps to explain why one matron celebrating thirty-five years of married life could declare with some pride that her husband had `` never seen her entirely naked '' , while another woman , boasting an equal number of years of married life , is proud of having `` shared the nudist way of life -- the really free , natural nude life -- for most of that period '' . Attempts at censorship always involve and reveal such complex and multiple individual reactions . The indignant crusader sees the nude or semi-nude human form as `` lewd and pornographic , a threat and danger '' to all the young , or good , or religious , or moral persons . The equally ardent proponent of freedom from any kind of censorship may find the nude human form the `` natural , honest , free expression of man's spirit and the epitome of beauty and inspiration '' . One is always a little surprised to bump into such individual distinctions when it is unexpected . I still recall the mild shock I experienced in reading material of an enthusiastic advocate of the `` clean , healthful , free way of natural life in nudism '' , who seemed to brave much misunderstanding and persecution in fine spirit . In tradition and in poetry , the marriage bed is a place of unity and harmony . The partners each bring to it unselfish love , and each takes away an equal share of pleasure and joy . At its most ecstatic moments , husband and wife are elevated far above worldly cares . Everything else is closed away . This is the ideal . But marriage experts say that such mutual contribution and mutual joy are seldom achieved . Instead one partner or the other dominates the sexual relationship . In the past , it has been the husband who has been dominant and the wife passive . But today there are signs that these roles are being reversed . In a growing number of American homes , marriage counselors report , the wife is taking a commanding role in sexual relationships . It is she who decides the time , the place , the surroundings , and the frequency of the sexual act . It is she who says aye or nay to the intimate questions of sexual technique and mechanics -- not the husband . The whole act is tailored to her pleasure , and not to theirs . Beyond a certain point , of course , no woman can be dominant -- nature has seen to that . But there is little doubt that in many marriages the wife is boss of the marital bed . Of course , there remain many `` old-fashioned '' marriages in which the husband maintains his supremacy . Yet even in these marriages , psychologists say , wives are asserting themselves more strongly . The meekest , most submissive wife of today is a tiger by her mother's or grandmother's standards . To many experts , this trend was inevitable . They consider it simply a sign of our times . Our society has `` emancipated '' the woman , giving her new independence and new authority . It is only natural that she assert herself in the sexual role . `` The sexual relationship does not exist in a vacuum '' , declares Dr. Mary Steichen Calderone , medical director of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and author of the recent book , Release From Sexual Tensions . `` It reflects what is going on in other areas of the marriage and in society itself . A world in which wives have taken a more active role is likely to produce sexual relationships in which wives are more self-assertive , too '' . Yet many psychologists and marriage counselors agree that domination of the sex relationship by one partner or the other can be unhealthy and even dangerous . It can , in fact , wreck a marriage . When a husband is sexually selfish and heedless of his wife's desires , she is cheated of the fulfillment and pleasure nature intended for her . And she begins to regard him as savage , bestial and unworthy . On the other hand , wifely supremacy demeans the husband , saps his self-respect , and robs him of his masculinity . He is a target of ridicule to his wife , and often -- since private affairs rarely remain private -- to the outside world as well . `` A marriage can survive almost any kind of stress except an open and direct challenge to the husband's maleness '' , declares Dr. Calderone . This opinion is supported by one of the nation's leading psychiatrists , Dr. Maurice E. Linden , director of the Mental Health Division of the Philadelphia Department of Public Health . `` When the roles of husband and wife are reversed , so that the wife becomes leader and the husband follower '' , Dr. Linden says , `` the effects on their whole relationship , sexual and otherwise , can be disastrous '' . In one extreme case , cited by a Pittsburgh psychologist , an office worker's wife refused to have sexual relations with her husband unless he bought her the luxuries she demanded . To win her favors , her husband first took an additional job , then desperately began to embezzle from his employer . Caught at last , he was sentenced to prison . While he was in custody his wife divorced him . More typical is the case of a suburban Long Island housewife described by a marriage counselor . This woman repeatedly complained she was `` too tired '' for marital relations . To please her , her husband assumed some of the domestic chores . Finally , he was cooking , washing dishes , bathing the children , and even ironing -- and still his wife refused to have relations as often as he desired them . One wife , described by a New York psychologist , so dominated her husband that she actually placed their sexual relationship on a schedule , writing it down right between the weekly PTA meetings and the Thursday-night neighborhood card parties . Another put sex on a dollars-and-cents basis . After every money argument , she rebuffed her husband's overtures until the matter was settled in her favor . Experts say the partners in marriages like these can almost be typed . The wife is likely to be young , sophisticated , smart as a whip -- often a girl who has sacrificed a promising career for marriage . She knows the power of the sex urge and how to use it to manipulate her husband . The husband is usually a well-educated professional , preoccupied with his job -- often an organization man whose motto for getting ahead is : `` Don't rock the boat '' . Sometimes this leads to his becoming demandingly dominant in marriage . Hemmed in on the job and unable to assert himself , he uses the sex act so he can be supreme in at least one area . More often , though , he is so accustomed to submitting to authority on the job without argument that he lives by the same rule at home . Some psychologists , in fact , suggest that career-bound husbands often are more to blame for topsy-turvy marriages than their wives . The wife's attempt at control , these psychologists contend , is sometimes merely a pathetic effort to compel her husband to pay as much attention to her as he does to his job . Naturally no woman can ever completely monopolize the sexual initiative . Unless her husband also desires sex , the act cannot be consummated . Generally , however , in such marriages as those cited , the husband is at his wife's mercy . `` The pattern '' , says Dr. Morton Schillinger , psychologist at New York's Lincoln Institute for Psychotherapy , `` is for the husband to hover about anxiously and eagerly , virtually trembling in his hope that she will flash him the signal that tonight is the night '' . No one seriously contends , of course , that the domineering wife is , sexually speaking , a new character in our world . After all , the henpecked husband with his shrewish wife is a comic figure of long standing , in literature and on the stage , as Dr. Schillinger points out . There is no evidence that these Milquetoasts became suddenly emboldened when they crossed the threshhold of the master bedroom . Furthermore , Dr. Calderone says , a certain number of docile , retiring men always have been around . They aren't `` frigid '' and they aren't homosexual ; ; they're just restrained in all of life . They like to be dominated . One such man once confided to Dr. Theodor Reik , New York psychiatrist , that he preferred to have his wife the sexual aggressor . Asked why , he replied primly : `` Because that's no activity for a gentleman '' . But such cases were , in the past , unusual . Society here and abroad has been built around the dominating male -- even the Bible appears to endorse the concept . Family survival on our own Western frontier , for example , could quite literally depend on a man's strength and ability to bring home the bacon ; ; and the dependent wife seldom questioned his judgment about anything , including the marriage bed . This carried over into the more urbanized late 19th and early 20th centuries , when the man ruled the roost in the best bull-roaring Life With Father manner . In those days , a wife had mighty few rights in the domestic sphere and even fewer in the sexual sphere . `` Grandma wasn't expected to like it '' , Dr. Marion Hilliard , the late Toronto gynecologist , once summed up the attitude of the '90s . Wives of the period shamefacedly thought of themselves as `` used '' by their husbands -- and , history indicates , they often quite literally were . When was the turning point ? When did women begin to assert themselves sexually ? Some date it from woman suffrage , others from when women first began to challenge men in the marketplace , still others from the era of the emancipated flapper and bathtub gin . Virtually everyone agrees , however , that the trend toward female sexual aggressiveness was tremendously accelerated with the postwar rush to the suburbs . Left alone while her husband was miles away in the city , the modern wife assumed more and more duties normally reserved for the male . Circumstances gave her almost undisputed sway over child-rearing , money-handling and home maintenance . She found she could cope with all kinds of problems for which she was once considered too helpless . She liked this taste of authority and independence , and , with darkness , was not likely to give it up . `` Very few wives '' , says Dr. Calderone , `` who balance the checkbook , fix the car , choose where the family will live and deal with the tradesmen , are suddenly going to become submissive where sex is concerned . A woman who dominates other family affairs will dominate the sexual relationship as well '' . And an additional factor was helping to make women more sexually self-assertive -- the comparatively recent discovery of the true depths of female desire and response . Marriage manuals and women's magazine articles began to stress the importance of the female climax . They began to describe in detail the woman's capacity for response . In fact , the noted psychologist and sex researcher , Dr. Albert Ellis , has declared flatly that women are `` sexually superior '' to men . According to Dr. Ellis , the average 20-year-old American woman is capable of far greater sexual arousal than her partner . Not surprisingly , Dr. Ellis says , some recently enlightened wives are out to claim these capabilities . Yet , paradoxically , according to Dr. Maurice Linden , many wives despise their husbands for not standing up to them . An aggressive woman wants a man to demand , not knuckle under . `` When the husband becomes passive in the face of his wife's aggressiveness '' , Dr. Linden says , `` the wife , in turn , finds him inadequate . Often she fails to gain sexual satisfaction '' . One such wife , Dr. Linden says , became disgusted with her weak husband and flurried through a series of extramarital affairs in the hope of finding a stronger man . But her personality was such that each affair lasted only until that lover , too , had been conquered and reduced to passivity . Then the wife bed-hopped to the next on the list . In some cases , however , domination of the sex act by one partner can be temporary , triggered by a passing but urgent emotional need . Thus a man who is butting a stone wall at the office may become unusually aggressive in bed -- the one place he can still be champion . If his on-the-job problems work out , he may return to his old pattern . Sometimes a burst of aggressiveness will sweep over a man -- or his wife -- because he or she feels age creeping up . On the other hand , a husband who always has been vigorous and assertive may suddenly become passive -- asking , psychologists say , for reassurance that his wife still finds him desirable . Or a wife may make sudden demands that she be courted , flattered or coaxed , simply because she needs her ego lifted . In any case , Dr. Calderone remarks , such problems are a couple's own affair , and can't always be measured by a general yardstick . `` As long as the couple is in agreement in their approach to sex , it makes little difference if one or the other dominates '' , Dr. Calderone declares . `` The important point is that both be satisfied with the adjustment '' . Other experts say , however , that if sexual domination by one or the other partner exists for longer than a brief period , it is likely to shake the marriage . And just as domination today often begins with the wife , so the cure generally must lie with the husband . `` To get a marriage back where it belongs '' , comments Dr. Schillinger of the Lincoln Institute , `` the husband must take some very basic steps . He must begin , paradoxically , by becoming more selfish . He must become more expressive of his own desires , more demanding and less ' understanding ' '' . Too many husbands , Dr. Schillinger continues , worry about `` how well they're doing '' , and fear that their success depends on some trick or technique of sexual play . She gave herself a title , Lady Diana Harrington . The New York D.A. gave her another , The Golden Girl of cafe society . Houston police gave her a third , less flamboyant , title , prostitute . And Houston police have the final say in the matter since she died there on September 20 , 1960 , `` Diane Harris Graham , 30 , D.O.A. , circumstances -- unusual '' . Early in her life she had discovered that where there were men , there was money , and with the two came luxury and liquor . She was still in the play for pay business when she died , a top trollop who had given the world's oldest profession one of its rare flashes of glamour . She never hid the fact that she liked to play . Her neighbors in the expensive Houston apartment building told reporters that the ash-blonde beauty had talked at times about her past as `` the Golden Girl of the Mickey Jelke trial '' . It was the trial of oleomargarine heir Minot ( Mickey ) Jelke for compulsory prostitution in New York that put the spotlight on the international play-girl . ( Jelke later served 21 months when he was found guilty of masterminding a ring of high-priced call girls . ) Diane was needed as a material witness in the case and New York police searched three continents before they found her in their own back yard -- in a swank hotel , of course . She had been moving in cafe society as Lady Diana Harrington , a name that made some of the gossip columns . It was when she was seized as a material witness that she got the designation she liked best . Clad in mink and diamonds , she listened to Assistant District Attorney Anthony Liebler describe her to the arraigning judge : `` This girl is the Golden Girl of cafe society . `` In 1951 she was a prostitute in New York County . In the spring and early summer of that year she met a wealthy foreign tycoon who took her to France , where she later met a very wealthy man and toured all Europe with him . `` At Deauville she met an Egyptian by the name of Pulley Bey . He was the official procurer for King Farouk , now in exile . She was in Egypt during the revolution and had passport difficulty . She lied in order to get it . `` We have checked her in different parts of Europe and Egypt and finally back into this country . She has been acting as a prostitute . `` Our information is that she gave the proceeds of her acts to Jelke '' . Diane sobbingly denied this to the court . `` That's a lie . I never gave that boy a cent . I am not a prostitute , and I had only one very wealthy boy friend '' , she said . During the course of the trial , Jelke backed up part of that statement . `` Diane is the type of girl '' , Jelke said , `` who wouldn't get loving -- even on her wedding night -- unless you piled up all your money in the middle of the floor '' . But she seemed to have underestimated the number of her `` boy friends '' . She came to New York from Detroit as a teenager , but with a `` sponsor '' instead of a chaperone . As she told it , `` He's a rich boy friend , an old guy about 60 '' . She was Mary Lou Brew then , wide-eyed , but not naive . She had talked her `` boy friend '' into sending her to New York to take a screen test . The screen test was never made -- but Diane was . She quickly moved into cafe society , possibly easing her conscience by talking constantly of her desire to be in show business . She seemed so anxious to go on the stage that some of her friends in the cocktail circuit set up a practical joke . An ex-fighter was introduced to her in a bar as `` Mr. Warfield , the famous producer '' . The phony producer asked her if she would like to be in one of his shows . `` I'd love to audition for you '' , she gushed . The audition was held a few minutes later in somebody's apartment . She thought she had great possibilities in the ballet and wanted to show the eminent producer how well she could dance . After a few minutes he said , `` I can't use you if you dance like that . I'd like to see you dance nude '' . She hastily complied . Diane loved to dance in the nude , something she was to demonstrate time and again . She developed another quaint habit . Even among the fast set in which she was moving , her method for keeping an escort from departing too early was unique . When the date would try to bid her good-night at the door , she would tell him , `` If you go home now , I'll scream '' . More often than not he would bow to the inevitable . One who needed no such threats was a French financier . One of the blonde's yearnings that he satisfied was for travel . She wanted to go around the world , but she settled for a French holiday . In an anonymous interview with a French newspaper the financier told of spending several months with her . `` Then she went to Deauville where she met a member of a powerful Greek syndicate of gamblers '' . The Greek evidently fell for her , `` Monsieur X '' recounted , and to clinch what he thought was an affair in the making he gave her 100,000 francs ( about $300 ) and led her to the roulette tables . She could do no wrong at the tables that time . And in short order the croupier had pushed several million francs her way . Smarter than most gamblers , she slipped away from the casino , packed her bag and took the night train to Paris . No one ever learned what happened to the Greek . The luxury of Paris' most fashionable hotel , the George 5 , , bored the beautifully-built blonde , so she high-tailed it to Rome . She teamed up with another beauty , whose name has been lost to history , and commenced with some fiddling that would have made Nero envious . To climax her Roman revels , she was thrown out of the swanky Hotel Excelsior after she had run naked through its marble halls screaming for help . It was a rugged finish for what must have been a very interesting night . Discreet Italian police described it in a manner typically continental . `` There had been a threesome at the party in the suite's bedroom : Miss Harrington ( this was Diane's choice for a Roman name ) , another woman who has figured in other very interesting events and one of your well-known American actors . `` The actor had had much to drink and apparently became very violent . The hotel staff , as well as residents of the Excelsior , told us they saw that both ladies were bleeding from scratches as they were seen fleeing down the hall . `` They were wearing nothing but their scratches . They were asked to leave the hotel . No charges were filed '' . The girls , after dressing , were indignant . `` You can't do this to us '' , Diane screamed . `` We are Americans '' . In the morning she found rooms directly across from the Excelsior at the equally luxurious Hotel Ambassador . With the Ambassador as headquarters , she continued to promote good will abroad . Of course , her benevolence was limited to those who could afford it , but then there is a limit to what one person can do . By this time Diane was a beguiling lass of 19 and still seeking her place in the world . She thought royal status might come her way when , while she was still in Rome , she met Pulley Bey , a personal procurer to King Farouk of Egypt . A close friend of hers in the Roman days described it this way : `` It was a strange relationship . Pulley Bey spoke no English . Diane spoke no Italian or French . She had a hard time making him understand that it was Farouk she wished to meet . `` Pulley Bey insisted that she bestow her favors on him '' , the friend continued . It seemed as though she were always auditioning . No believer in the traditional devotion of royal servitors , the plump Pulley broke the language barrier and lured her to Cairo where she waited for nine months , vainly hoping to see Farouk . Pulley had set her up at the Semiramis Hotel , but she grew impatient waiting for a royal reception and moved to a luxurious apartment to which the royal pimp had no key . She picked her own Middle-Eastern friends from the flock of ardent Egyptians that buzzed around her . Tewfik Badrawi , Mohammed Gaafer and numerous other wealthy members of Cairo society enjoyed her company . `` So extensive became her circle of admirers '' , Egyptian police said , `` that her escapades caused distrust '' . The roof was about ready to fall in on Diane's little world , but it took nothing less than the Egyptian revolution to bring it down . When Farouk was overthrown , police picked up his personal pimp , Pulley Bey . They also called upon Diane with a request for a look at her passport . The cagey Pulley Bey , who spoke no English , had taken the passport so that Diane couldn't leave the country without his approval . Officials provided a temporary passport , good only for return to the United States . And return to the United States she did , into waiting arms -- the unromantic ones of the New York District Attorney's office . Held as a material witness in the compulsory prostitution trial of Mickey Jelke , the comely courtesan was unable to raise bail and was committed to the Women's House of Detention , a terribly overcrowded prison . It is a tribute to her talents that she was able to talk the District Attorney into having her removed from the prison to a hotel room , with her meals taken at Vesuvio's , an excellent Italian restaurant . Newspapers at the time noted that the move indicated that she was co-operating with the District Attorney . With the end of the trial Diane disappeared from New York . It was no longer fashionable to be seen with fabulous `` Lady Harrington '' . Several years ago she married a Houston business man , Robert Graham . She later divorced Graham , who is believed to have moved to Bolivia . Houston police got to know Diane two years ago when the vice squad picked her up for questioning about a call girl ring . Last May , they said , she admitted being a prostitute . The next time the police saw her she was dead . It was September 20 , 1960 , in a lavishly decorated apartment littered with liquor bottles . She had had a party with a regular visitor , Dr. William W. McClellan . McClellan , who had once lost his medical license temporarily on a charge of drug addiction , was with her when she died . He had been in the apartment two days and was hazy about what had happened during that time . When he realized she was dead , he called two lawyers and then the police . When the police arrived , they found McClellan and the two lawyers sitting and staring silently . The blonde's nude body was in bed , a green sheet and a pink blanket covered her . Pictures of her in more glamorous days were on the walls . An autopsy disclosed a large amount of morphine in Diane's body . Police theorize that a combination of dope , drink and drugs killed her . `` I think that maybe she wanted it this way '' , a vice squad cop said . `` A maid told us that she still bragged about getting $50 a date . She was on the junk , and they slide fast when that happens . At least she never knew what the bottom was like '' . I am a carpet salesman . I work for one of the biggest chains of retail carpet houses in the East . We cater mostly to nice people in the $5-8,000 annual income bracket and we run a string of snazzy , neon-lit , chromium-plated suburban stores . I am selling the stuff of which is made one of the Great American Dreams -- wall-to-wall carpeting . There is only one trouble with this big , beautiful dream . From where I sit it looks more like a nightmare . People come to me with confidence . They depend on my supposedly expert knowledge of a trade of which they themselves know little . But I knowingly abuse their confidence . Franklin D. Lee proved a man of prompt action when Mrs. Claire Shaefer , accompanied by a friend , visited him in Bakersfield , California , several months ago as a prospective patient . `` Doctor '' Lee asked her to lie down on a bed and remove her shoes . Then , by squeezing her foot three times , he came up -- presto -- with a different diagnosis with each squeeze . She had -- he informed her -- kidney trouble , liver trouble , and a severe female disorder . ( He explained that he could diagnose these ailments from squeezing her foot because all of the nervous system was connected to it . ) He knew just the thing for her -- a treatment from his `` cosmic light ozone generator '' machine . As he applied the applicator extending from the machine -- which consisted of seven differently colored neon tubes superimposed on a rectangular base -- to the supposedly diseased portions of Mrs. Shaefer's body , Lee kept up a steady stream of pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo . Yes , the ozone from his machine would cure practically everything , he assured her . Did she know , he asked , why the colors of the tubes were important to people's health ? The human body -- he pointed out , for example -- required 33 units of blue light . For that reason , he informed her , the Lord made the sky blue . Continuing glibly in this vein , he paused to comfort her : `` Don't you worry . This machine will cure your cancer-ridden body '' . `` Cancer '' ! Mrs. Shaefer practically shrieked . `` You didn't tell me I had cancer '' . `` You have it , all right . But as long as you can have treatment from my machine you have nothing to worry about . Why , I once used this machine to cure a woman with 97 pounds of cancer in her body '' . He urged her to buy one of his machines -- for $300 . When she said that she didn't have the money , he said that she could come in for treatment with his office model until she was ready to buy one . He then sold her minerals to cure her kidney ailment , a can of sage `` to make her look like a girl again '' , and an application of plain mud to take her wrinkles away . Lee renewed his pressure on Mrs. Shaefer to buy his machine when she visited him the next day . After another treatment with the machine , he told her that `` her entire body was shot through with tumors and cysts '' . He then sold her some capsules that he asserted would take care of the tumors and cysts until she could collect the money for buying his machine . When she submitted to his treatment with the capsules , Mrs. Shaefer felt intense pain . Leaving Lee's office , Mrs. Shaefer hurried over to her family physician , who treated her for burned tissue . For several days , she was ill as a result of Lee's treatment . Mrs. Shaefer never got around to joining the thousand or so people who paid Lee some $30,000 for his ozone machines . For Mrs. Shaefer -- who had been given a clean bill of health by her own physician at the time she visited Lee -- and her friend were agents for the California Pure Food and Drug Inspection Bureau . And she felt amply rewarded for her suffering when the evidence of Lee's quack shenanigans , gathered by the tape recorder under her friend's clothing , proved adequate in court for convicting Franklin D. Lee . The charge : violation of the California Medical Practices Act by practicing medicine without a license and selling misbranded drugs . The sentence : 360 days' confinement in the county jail . An isolated case of quackery ? By no means . Rather , it is typical of the thousands of quacks who use phony therapeutic devices to fatten themselves on the miseries of hundreds of thousands of Americans by robbing them of millions of dollars and luring them away from legitimate , ethical medical treatment of serious diseases . The machine quack makes his Rube Goldberg devices out of odds and ends of metals , wires , and radio parts . With these gadgets -- impressive to the gullible because of their flashing light bulbs , ticks , and buzzes -- he then carries out a vicious medical con game , capitalizing on people's respect for the electrical and atomic wonders of our scientific age . He milks the latest scientific advances , translating them into his own special Buck Rogers vocabulary to huckster his fake machines as a cure-all for everything from hay fever to sexual impotence and cancer . The gadget faker operates or sells his phony machines for $5 to $10,000 -- anything the traffic will bear . He may call himself a anaprapath , a physiotherapist , an electrotherapist , a naturopath , a sanipractor , a medical cultist , a masseur , a `` doctor '' -- or what have you . Not only do these quacks assume impressive titles , but represent themselves as being associated with various scientific or impressive foundations -- foundations which often have little more than a letterhead existence . The medical device pirate of today , of course , is a far more sophisticated operator than his predecessor of yesteryear -- the gallus-snapping hawker of snake oil and other patent medicines . His plunder is therefore far higher -- running into hundreds of millions . According to the Food And Drug Administration ( FDA ) , `` Doctor '' Ghadiali , Dr. Albert Abrams and his clique , and Dr. Wilhelm Reich -- to name three notorious device quacks -- succeeded , respectively , in distributing 10,000 , 5000 , and 2000 fake health machines . Authorities believe that many of the Doctor Frauds using these false health gadgets are still in business . Look at the sums paid by two device quack victims in Cleveland . Sarah Gross , a dress shop proprietor , paid $1020 to a masseur , and Mr. A. , a laborer , paid $4200 to a chiropractor for treatment with two fake health machines -- the `` radioclast '' and the `` diagnometer '' . Multiply these figures by the millions of people known to be conned by medical pirates annually . You will come up with a frightening total . That's why the FDA , the American Medical Association ( AMA ) , and the National Better Business Bureau ( BBB ) have estimated the toll of mechanical quackery to be a substantial portion of the $610 million or so paid to medical charlatans annually . The Postmaster General recently reported that mail order frauds -- among which fake therapeutic devices figure prominently -- are at the highest level in history . Similarly , the American Cancer Society ( ACS ) , the Arthritis and Rheumatism Foundation , and the BBB have each stated lately that medical quackery is at a new high . For example , the BBB has reported it was receiving four times as many inquiries about quack devices and 10 times as many complaints compared with two years ago . Authorities hesitate to quote exact figures , however , believing that any sum they come up with is only a surface manifestation -- turned up by their inevitably limited policing -- of the real loot of the medical racketeer . In this sense , authorities believe that all estimates of phony device quackery are conservative . The economic toll that the device quack extracts is important , of course . But it is our health -- more precious than all the money in the world -- that these modern witch doctors with their fake therapeutic gadgets are gambling away . By preying on the sick , by playing callously on the hopes of the desperate , by causing the sufferer to delay proper medical care , these medical ghouls create pain and misery by their very activity . Typically , Sarah Gross and Mr. A both lost more than their money as the result of their experiences with their Cleveland quacks . Sarah Gross found that the treatments given her for a nervous ailment by the masseur were not helping her . As a result , she consulted medical authorities and learned that the devices her quack `` doctor '' was using were phony . She suffered a nervous breakdown and had to be institutionalized . Mr. A. , her fellow townsman , also experienced a nervous breakdown just as soon as he discovered that he had been bilked of his life savings by the limited practitioner who had been treating his wife -- a woman suffering from an incurable disease , multiple sclerosis -- and himself . Mr. A has recovered , but he is , justifiably , a bitter man . `` That's a lot of hard-earned money to lose '' , he says today . `` Neither me nor my wife were helped by that chiropractor's treatments '' . And there was the case of Tom Hepker , a machinist , who was referred by a friend to a health machine quack who treated him with a so-called diagnostic machine for what Doctor Fraud said was a system full of arsenic and strychnine . After his pains got worse , Tom decided to see a real doctor , from whom he learned he was suffering from cancer of the lung . Yes , Tom caught it in time to stay alive . But he's a welfare case now -- a human wreck -- thanks to this modern witch doctor . But the machine quack can cause far more than just suffering . In such diseases as cancer , tuberculosis , and heart disease , early diagnosis and treatment are so vital that the waste of time by the patient with Doctor Fraud's cure-all gadget can prove fatal . Moreover , the diabetic patient who relies on cure by the quack device and therefore cuts off his insulin intake can be committing suicide . For instance : In Chicago , some time ago , Mr. H. , age 27 , a diabetic since he was six , stopped using insulin because he had bought a `` magic spike '' -- a glass tube about the size of a pencil filled with barium chloride worth a small fraction of a cent -- sold by the Vrilium Company of Chicago for $306 as a cure-all . `` Hang this around your neck or attach it to other parts of your anatomy , and its rays will cure any disease you have '' , said the company . Mr. H. is dead today because he followed this advice . Doris Hull , suffering from tuberculosis , was taken by her husband to see Otis G. Carroll , a sanipractor -- a licensed drugless healer -- in Spokane . Carroll diagnosed Mrs. Hull by taking a drop of blood from her ear and putting it on his `` radionic '' machine and twirling some knobs ( fee $50 ) . His prescription : hot and cold compresses to increase her absorption of water . Although she weighed only 108 pounds when she visited him , Carroll permitted her to go on a 10-day fast in which she took nothing but water . Inevitably , Mrs. Hull died of starvation and tuberculosis , weighing 60 pounds . Moreover , her husband and child contracted T.B. from her . ( Small wonder a Spokane jury awarded the husband $35,823 for his wife's death . ) In California , a few years ago , a ghoul by the name of H. F. Bell sold electric blankets as a cure for cancer . He did this by the charming practice of buying up used electric blankets for $5 to $10 from survivors of patients who had died , reconditioning them , and selling them at $185 each . When authorities convicted him of practicing medicine without a license ( he got off with a suspended sentence of three years because of his advanced age of 77 ) , one of his victims was not around to testify : He was dead of cancer . By no means are these isolated cases . `` Unfortunately '' , says Chief Postal Inspector David H. Stephens , who has prosecuted many device quacks , `` the ghouls who trade on the hopes of the desperately ill often cannot be successfully prosecuted because the patients who are the chief witnesses die before the case is called up in court '' . Death ! Have no doubt about it . That's where device quackery can lead . The evidence shows that fake therapeutic machines , substituted for valid medical cures , have hastened the deaths of thousands . Who are the victims of the device quacks ? Authorities say that oldsters are a prime target . Says Wallace F. Jannsen , director of the FDA's Division of Public Information : `` Quacks are apt to direct their appeal directly to older people , or to sufferers from chronic ailments such as arthritis , rheumatism , diabetes , and cancer . People who have not been able to get relief from regular medical doctors are especially apt to be taken in by quacks '' . The victims of the quacks are frequently poor people , like Mr. A. , who scrape up their life savings to offer as a sacrifice to Doctor Fraud's avarice . They are often ignorant as well as underprivileged . Ten-year-old Richard Stewart had been irritable and quarrelsome for almost a year . His grades had gone steadily downhill , and he had stopped bringing friends and classmates home from school . Mr. and Mrs. Stewart were puzzled and concerned . Then one day Dick's classmate Jimmy , from next door , let the cat out of the bag . The youngsters in the boys' class had nicknamed Dick `` Bugs Bunny '' because his teeth protruded . When Richard's parents told him they wanted to take him to an orthodontist -- a dentist who specializes in realigning teeth and jaws -- their young son was interested . During the year that followed , Dick co-operated whole-heartedly with the dentist and was delighted with the final result achieved -- an upper row of strong straight teeth that completely changed his facial appearance . Richard Stewart is no special case . `` The majority of children in the United States could benefit by some form of orthodontic treatment '' , says Dr. Allan G. Brodie , professor and head of the department of orthodontics at the University of Illinois and a nationally recognized authority in his field . What do parents need to know about those `` years of the braces '' in order not to waste a child's time and their money ? How can they tell whether a child needs orthodontic treatment ? Why and when should tooth-straightening be undertaken ? What is it likely to cost ? Tooth fit explained occlusion is the dentist's expression for the way teeth fit together when the jaws are closed . Malocclusion , or a bad fit , is what parents need to look out for . One main type of malocclusion is characterized by a receding chin and protruding upper front teeth . A chin too prominent in relation to the rest of the face , a thrusting forward of the lower front teeth , an overdeveloped lower jawbone , and an underdeveloped upper jaw indicate the opposite type of malocclusion . These two basic malformations have , of course , many variations . A child probably requires some form of treatment if he has any of the following conditions : A noticeable protrusion of the upper or lower jaw . Crooked , overlapping , twisted , or widely spaced teeth . Front teeth not meeting when the back teeth close . Upper teeth completely covering the lowers when the back teeth close . The eyeteeth ( third from the middle on top , counting each front tooth as the first ) beginning to protrude like fangs . Second teeth that have come in before the first ones have fallen out , making a double row . Contrary to the thinking of 30 to 40 years ago , when all malocclusion was blamed on some unfortunate habit , recent studies show that most tooth irregularity has at least its beginning in hereditary predisposition . However , this does not mean that a child's teeth or jaws must necessarily resemble those of someone in his family . Tooth deformity may be the result of excessive thumb- or finger-sucking , tongue-thrusting , or lip-sucking -- but it's important to remember that there's a difference between normal and excessive sucking habits . It's perfectly normal for babies to suck their thumbs , and no mother need worry if a child continues this habit until he is two or three years old . Occasional sucking up to the fifth year may not affect a youngster's teeth ; ; but after that , if thumb-sucking pressure is frequent , it will have an effect . Malocclusion can also result if baby teeth are lost too soon or retained too long . If a child loses a molar at the age of two , the adjoining teeth may shift toward the empty space , thus narrowing the place intended for the permanent ones and producing a jumble . If baby teeth are retained too long , the incoming second teeth may be prevented from emerging at the normal time or may have to erupt in the wrong place . Correction can save teeth every orthodontist sees children who are embarrassed by their malformed teeth . Some such youngsters rarely smile , or they try to speak with the mouth closed . In certain cases , as in Dick Stewart's , a child's personality is affected . Yet from the dentist's point of view , bad-fitting teeth should be corrected for physical reasons . Bad alignment may result in early loss of teeth through a breakdown of the bony structure that supports their roots . This serious condition , popularly known as pyorrhea , is one of the chief causes of tooth loss in adults . Then , too , misplaced or jammed-together teeth are prone to trapping food particles , increasing the likelihood of rapid decay . `` For these and other reasons '' , says Dr. Brodie , `` orthodontics can prolong the life of teeth '' . The failure of teeth to fit together when closed interferes with normal chewing , so that a child may swallow food whole and put a burden on his digestive system . Because of these chewing troubles , a child may avoid certain foods he needs for adequate nutrition . Badly placed teeth can also cause such a speech handicap as lisping . The when and how of straightening `` most orthodontic work is done on children between the ages of 10 and 14 , though there have been patients as young as two and as old as 55 '' , says Dr. Brodie . In the period from 10 to 14 the permanent set of teeth is usually completed , yet the continuing growth of bony tissue makes moving badly placed teeth comparatively easy . Orthodontic work is possible because teeth are held firmly but not rigidly , by a system of peridontal membrane with an involved nerve network , to the bone in the jaw ; ; they are not anchored directly to the bone . Abnormal pressure , applied over a period of time , produces a change in the bony deposit , so a tooth functions normally in the new position into which it has been guided . What can 10-year-old Susan expect when she enters the orthodontist's office ? On her first visit the orthodontist will take x-rays , photographs , tooth measurements , and `` tooth prints '' -- an impression of the mouth that permits him to study her teeth and jaws . If he decides to proceed , he will custom-make for Susie an appliance consisting of bands , plastic plates , fine wires , and tiny springs . This appliance will exert a gentle and continuous or intermittent pressure on the bone . As the tooth moves , bone cells on the pressure side of it will dissolve , and new ones will form on the side from which the tooth has moved . This must be done at the rate at which new bony tissue grows , and no faster . `` If teeth are moved too rapidly , serious injury can be done to their roots as well as to the surrounding bone holding them in place '' , explains Dr. Brodie . `` Moving one or two teeth can affect the whole system , and an ill-conceived plan of treatment can disrupt the growth pattern of a child's face '' . During the first few days of wearing the appliance and immediately following each adjustment , Susan may have a slight discomfort or soreness , but after a short time this will disappear . Parents are often concerned that orthodontic appliances may cause teeth to decay . When in place , a well-cemented band actually protects the part of the tooth that is covered . Next Susie will enter the treatment stage and visit the orthodontist once or twice a month , depending on the severity of her condition . During these visits the dentist will adjust the braces to increase the pressure on her teeth . Last comes the retention stage . Susie's teeth have now been guided into a desirable new position . But because teeth sometimes may drift back to their original position , a retaining appliance is used to lock them in place . Usually this is a thin band of wire attached to the molars and stretching across the teeth . Susie may wear this only at night or for a few hours during the day . Then comes the time when the last wire is removed and Susie walks out a healthier and more attractive girl than when she first went to the orthodontist . How long will this take ? Straightening one tooth that has come in wrong may take only a few months . Aligning all the teeth may take a year or more . An added complication such as a malformed jaw may take two or three years to correct . What is the cost ? ? The charge for a complete full-banded job differs in various parts of the country . Work that might cost $500 to $750 in the South could cost $750 to $1,200 in New York City or Chicago . An average national figure for two to three years of treatment would be $650 to $1,000 . `` Factors in the cost of treatment are the length of time involved and the skill and education of the practitioner '' , says Dr. Brodie . To become an orthodontist , a man must first be licensed by his state as a dentist , then he must spend at least two years in additional training to acquire a license as a specialist . `` Costs may seem high , but they used to be even higher '' , says Dr. Brodie . `` Fees are about half to a third of what they were 25 years ago '' . The reason ? People today are aware of the value of orthodontics , and as a result there are more practitioners in the field . Most orthodontists require an initial payment to cover the cost of diagnostic materials and construction of the appliances , but usually the remainder of the cost may be spread over a period of months or years . In many cities in the United States clinics associated with dental schools will take patients at a nominal fee . Some municipal agencies will pay for orthodontic treatment for children of needy parents . Research helps families growth studies have been carried on consistently by orthodontists . Dr. Brodie has 30-year records of head growth , started 20 minutes after children's births . `` In the past anyone who said that 90% of all malocclusion is hereditary was scoffed at ; ; now we know that family characteristics do affect tooth formation to a large extent '' , he says . `` Fortunately through our growth studies we have been able to see what nature does , and that helps us know what we can do '' . This knowledge both modifies and dictates diagnosis and treatment . For example , a boy may inherit a small jaw from one ancestor and large teeth from another . In the past an orthodontist might have tried , over four or five years , to straighten and fit the boy's large teeth into a jaw that , despite some growth , would never accommodate them . Now a dentist can recommend extraction immediately . In other cases , in view of present-day knowledge of head growth , orthodontists will recommend waiting four or five years before treatment . The child is kept on call , and the orthodontist watches the growth . `` Nature often takes care of the problem '' , says Dr. Brodie . `` A child with a certain type of head and teeth will outgrow tooth deformity '' . That is why Dr. Brodie asks parents not to insist , against their dentist's advice , that their child have orthodontic work done too early . `` Both because of our culture's stress on beauty and our improved economic conditions , some parents demand that the dentist try to correct a problem before it is wise to do so . Let the orthodontist decide the proper time to start treatment '' , he urges . Superior new material for orthodontic work is another result of research . Plastics are easier to handle than the vulcanized rubber formerly used , and they save time and money . Plaster of Paris , once utilized in making impressions of teeth , has been replaced by alginates ( gelatin-like material ) that work quickly and accurately and with least discomfort to a child . Prevention is best as a rule , the earlier general dental treatment is started , the less expensive and more satisfactory it is likely to be . `` After your child's baby teeth are all in -- usually at the age of two and one half to three -- it's time for that first dental appointment '' , Dr. Brodie advises . `` Then see that your youngster has a routine checkup once a year '' . To help prevent orthodontic problems from arising , your dentist can do these things : He can correct decay , thus preventing early loss of teeth . If a child does lose his first teeth prematurely because of decay -- and if no preventive steps are taken -- the other teeth may shift out of position , become overcrowded and malformed . In turn the other teeth are likely to decay because food particles may become impacted in them . From time to time the medium mentions other people `` around him '' , who were `` on the other side '' , and reports what they are saying . After a while there come initials and names , and he is interested to hear some rather unusual family nicknames . As the hour progresses , the sensitive seems to probe more deeply and to make more personal and specific statements . There are a few prognoses of coming events . Another medium , another sitter , would produce a somewhat different content , but in general it would probably sound much like the foregoing reading . Some mediums speak in practical , down-to-earth terms , while others may stress the spiritual . Not all , as a matter of fact , consider themselves `` mediums '' in the sense of receiving messages from the deceased . In fact , some sensitives rule this out , preferring to consider their expression as strictly extra-sensory perception ( ESP ) , on this side of the `` veil '' . However that may be , people are known to go to mediums for diverse reasons . Perhaps they are mourning a recent death and want comfort , to feel in touch with the deceased , or seek indications for future plans . They may , of course , be curiosity seekers -- or they may just be interested in the phenomenon of mediumship . The mediums with whom the Parapsychology Foundation is working in this experiment are in a waking or only slightly dissociated state , so that the sitter can make comments , ask and answer questions , instead of talking with a `` control '' who speaks through an entranced sensitive . What we have here is in some ways more like an ordinary conversation . But it is not really only a conversation . Many a sitter ( in a personal sitting ) has been amazed to realize that the medium was describing very vividly his state of mind . He himself might not have been really aware of his own mood ; ; it had been latent , unspecified , semi-conscious and only partly realized -- until she described it to him ! Most striking indeed is this beyond-normal ability to put a finger on `` pre-conscious '' moods and to clarify them . However , in the next visit that the researcher made to the medium , he did not receive a personal reading . Instead he brought with him the names of some people he had never met and of whom the medium knew nothing . For this was to be a `` proxy sitting '' . As was noted earlier , it is important that in valid , objective study of this sort of communication , the interested sitter should be separated from the sensitive . Dr. Karlis Osis , Director of Research at the Parapsychology Foundation , described the basis for the experiment in a tomorrow article , ( `` New Research On Survival After Death '' , Spring 1958 ) . He remarked : `` It has been clearly established that in a number of instances the message did not come from a spirit but was received telepathically by the medium from the sitter '' . The possibility has to be ruled out that the medium's ESP may tap the memory of the sitter , and to do this , the two central characters in this drama must be separated . One way to do this is by `` proxy sittings '' , wherein the person seeking a message does not himself meet with the medium but is represented by a substitute , the proxy sitter . If the latter knows nothing about the absent sitter except his name ( given by the experimenter ) , he cannot possibly give any clues , conscious or unconscious , far less ask leading questions . All he can do is to be an objective and careful questioner , seeking to help the sensitive in clarifying and making more specific her paranormal impressions . Sometimes in these experiments `` appointment sittings '' are used . Here the absent sitter makes a `` date '' with a communicator ( someone close to him who is deceased ) , asking him to `` come in '' at a certain hour , when a channel will be open for him . In this case the proxy sitter will know only the name of the communicator , nothing else . He gives this to the medium at the appointed time , and the reading then will be concerned with material about or messages from the communicator . As always , a tape recording or detailed notes are made , and a typescript of this is sent to the absent sitter . So this proxy situation has set up at least a partial barrier between the medium's ESP and the absent sitter's mind . It is now harder to assume telepathy as a basis for the statements -- though research still does not know how far afield ESP can range . Now the original absent sitter must decide whether the statements are meaningful to him . Here again laboratory approaches are being evolved , for it is recognized how `` elastic '' these readings can be , how they can apply to many people , and are often stated in general terms all too easily applied to any individual's own case . If you look at a reading meant for someone else , you will probably see that many of the items could be considered as applicable to you , even when you were not in the picture at all ! An interested sitter may think the sensitive has made a `` hit '' , describing something accurately for him , but can he really be sure that another sitter , hearing the same statement , would not apply it subjectively to his own circumstances ? It is , of course , easy to see how `` J '' will mean Uncle Jack to one person and little Jane to another . `` A journey '' , `` a little white house '' , `` a change of outlook '' , can apply to many people . And even more complex items can be interpreted to conform to one's own point of view , which is by nature so personal . One sitter may think `` a leather couch '' identifies a reading as surely directed to him ; ; to another , it seems that nobody but his father ever used the phrase , `` Atta boy '' ! To get around this quite difficult corner , there is one first aid to objectiveness : prevent the distant sitter from knowing which reading was for him . If he is not told which of four or five readings was meant for him , he can more readily assess each item in a larger frame : `` Does that statement really sound as if it were for me , significant in my particular life ? Or am I taking something that could really apply to almost anybody , and forgetting that many other people probably have had a similar experience '' ? Conversely , experimenters would consider as impressive such statements as the following , which , if they turned out to be hits , are so unusual as to be really significant : `` He had four children , two sets of twins . After being a lawyer for twenty-five years he started studying for the ministry . Part of his house had been moved to the other side of the road . He died of typhoid in 1921 '' . Methods have been developed of assigning `` weights '' to statements ; ; that is , it is known empirically that names beginning with R are more common than those beginning with Z ; ; that fewer women are named Miranda than Elizabeth ; ; that in the United States more people die of heart disease than of smallpox . So each reading can be given a weight and each reading a score by adding up these weights . Specific dates would be important , as would double names . Various categories have been explored to find out about these `` empirical probabilities '' against which to measure the readings . In the parapsychology foundation's long-range experiment , readings are made by a variety of sensitives for a large number of cooperating sitters , trying to throw light on this question of the significance of mediumistic statements . It is very important indeed , in the field of extra-sensory perception and its relation to the survival hypothesis , to know whether the statements are actually only those which any intuitive person might venture and an eager sitter attach to himself . Or , on the other hand , are unlikely facts being stated , facts which are in themselves significant and not easily applicable to everybody ? That is one thing the experiments are designed to find out . So , after the sitting has been held , several readings at one time are mailed , and the distant sitter ( whose name or whose communicator's name was given to the medium ) must mark each little item as Correct ( Hit ) , Incorrect ( Miss ) , Doubtful , or Especially Significant ( applying to him and , he feels , not to anyone else ) . He is required to mark every item and to indicate which reading he feels is actually his . All these evaluations are then totted up and tabulated , by adding up the Hits and Significants , with the weight placed on those in the sitter's own reading . That is , if he marks as most correct a reading not meant for him , the total experimental score falls . Conversely , if he gives a heavy rating to his own reading , and finds more accurate facts in it than in the others , a point is chalked up for the intrinsic , objective meaningfulness of this type of mediumistic material . And there are some positive results , though the final findings will not be known for a long time -- and then further research can be formulated . In another approach to the same procedure , the content of the readings is analyzed so as to see how the particular medium is likely to slant her statements . Does she often speak of locations , of cause of death ? Does she accurately give dates , ages , kind of occupation ? It is possible to find out in which categories most of her correct statements fall , and where she makes most of her `` hits '' . Now when , so to speak , the cream has been skimmed off , and the items in the successful categories separated out , the sitter can be asked to consider and rate only this concentrated `` cream '' , where the sensitive is at her best . Mediumistic impressions are evidently of all sorts and seem to involve all the senses . `` I feel cold '' , the medium says , or `` My leg aches '' , `` My head is heavy '' . Or perhaps she hears words or sounds : `` There's such a noise of loud machinery '' , or `` I hear a child crying '' , or `` He says we're all here and glad to see you '' . Maybe an entire scene comes into consciousness , with action and motion , or a static view : `` a house under a pine tree , with a little stone path going up to the door '' . The sensitive often seems to smell definite odors , too , or subjectively feels emotions . Sometimes she displays amazing eidetic imagery and seems to see all details in perspective , as if the scene were actually there . If pressed by the sitter for more detail , she may be able to bring the picture more into focus and see more sharply , almost as if she were physically going closer . If asked how she gets her impressions , she probably can only say that she `` just gets them '' -- some more vividly than others . Perhaps this is not so extraordinary after all . Even in normal experience one gets impressions without knowing exactly how -- of atmosphere , of one another's personalities , moods , intentions . Of course , there is an element of training here : these gifted people , by concentration , study , guidance , have learned to develop their power . Simply using it increases its intensity , I was told by one sensitive . Nor does a medium automatically know how to interpret her imagery . Impressions often appear in a symbolic form and cannot be taken at face value . It is apparently by symbols that the unconscious speaks to the conscious , and the medium has to translate these into meaning . If communication with an entity on the `` other side '' is taking place , this too may assume the form of clairvoyant symbolism . During one reading an image appeared of a prisoner in irons . But this did not necessarily refer to an actual jail ; ; taken with other details it could have referred to a state of mental or spiritual confinement . In this connection it is worth noting how names are sometimes obtained . Though they are often heard clairaudiently , as if a voice were speaking them , in other cases they are apprehended visually as symbols : a slope to signify the name `` Hill '' , for instance . One medium saw two sheets flapping on a line and found that the name Shietz was significant to the sitter . Farming is confining . The farmer's life must be arranged to meet the demands of crops and livestock . Livestock must be tended every day , routinely . A slight change in the work schedule may cut the production of cows or chickens . Even if there are no livestock , the farmer cannot leave the farm for long periods , particularly during the growing season . The worker who lives on a farm cannot change jobs readily . He cannot leave the farm to take work in another locality on short notice ; ; such a move may mean a loss of capital . Hard physical labor and undesirable hours are a part of life . The farmer must get up early , and , at times , work late at night . Frequently he must work long hours in the hot sun or cold rain . No matter how well work is planned , bad weather or unexpected setbacks can cause extra work that must be caught up . It may not be profitable for a part-time farmer to own the labor-saving machinery that a full-time farmer can invest in profitably . Production may fall far below expectations . Drought , hail , disease , and insects take their toll of crops . Sickness or loss of some of the livestock may cut into the owner's earnings , even into his capital . Returns for money and labor invested may be small even in a good year . The high cost of land , supplies , and labor make it difficult to farm profitably on a part-time basis . Land within commuting distance of a growing city is usually high in price , higher if it has subdivision possibilities . Part-time farmers generally must pay higher prices for supplies than full-time farmers because they buy in smaller quantities . If the farm is in an industrial area where wages are high , farm labor costs will also be high . A part-time farmer needs unusual skill to get as high production per hen , per cow , or per acre as can be obtained by a competent full-time farmer . It will frequently be uneconomical for him to own the most up-to-date equipment . He may have to depend upon custom service for specialized operations , such as spraying or threshing , and for these , he may have to wait his turn . There will be losses caused by emergencies that arise while he is away at his off-farm job . The farm may be an additional burden if the main job is lost . This may be true whether the farm is owned or rented . If the farm is rented , the rent must be paid . If it is owned , taxes must be paid , and if the place is not free of mortgage , there will be interest and payments on the principal to take care of . Advantages A farm provides a wholesome and healthful environment for children . It gives them room to play and plenty of fresh air . The children can do chores adapted to their age and ability . Caring for a calf , a pig , or some chickens develops in children a sense of responsibility for work . Part-time farming gives a measure of security if the regular job is lost , provided the farm is owned free of debt and furnishes enough income to meet fixed expenses and minimum living costs . For some retired persons , part-time farming is a good way to supplement retirement income . It is particularly suitable for those who need to work or exercise out of doors for their health . Generally , the same level of living costs less in the country than in the city . The savings are not as great , however , as is sometime supposed . Usually , the cost of food and shelter will be somewhat less on the farm and the cost of transportation and utilities somewhat more . Where schools , fire and police protection , and similar municipal services are of equal quality in city and country , real estate taxes are usually about the same . A part-time farmer and his family can use their spare time profitably . Some persons consider the work on a farm recreational . For some white-collar workers it is a welcome change from the regular job , and a physical conditioner . Land , labor , and equipment needed Part-time farming can take comparatively little land , labor , and equipment -- or a great deal . It depends on the kind and the scale of the farming operation . General requirements for land , labor , and equipment are discussed below . Specific requirements for each of various types of enterprises are discussed on pages 8 to 14 . Land Three quarters to 1 acre of good land is enough for raising fruits and vegetables for home use , and for a small flock of chickens , a cow , and two pigs . You could not , of course , raise feed for the livestock on a plot this small . If you want to raise feed or carry out some enterprise on a larger scale , you'll need more land . In deciding how much land you want , take into account the amount you'll need to bring in the income you expect . But consider also how much you and your family can keep up along with your other work . The cost of land and the prospects for appreciation in value may influence your decision . Some part-time farmers buy more land than they need in anticipation of suburban development . This is a highly speculative venture . Sometimes a desired acreage is offered only as part of a larger tract . When surplus land is not expensive to buy or to keep up , it is usually better to buy it than to buy so small an acreage that the development of adjoining properties might impair the residential value of the farm . Labor If you have a year-round , full-time job you can't expect to grow much more than your family uses -- unless other members of the family do a good deal of the work or you hire help . As a rule , part-time farmers hire little help . In deciding on the enterprises to be managed by family labor , compare the amount of labor that can be supplied by the family with the labor needs of various enterprises listed in table 1 . List the number of hours the family can be expected to work each month . You may want to include your own regular vacation period if you have one . Do not include all your spare time or all your family's spare time -- only what you are willing to use for farm work . Equipment If you are going to produce for home use only , you will need only hand tools . You will probably want to hire someone to do the plowing , however . For larger plantings , you'll need some kind of power for plowing , harrowing , disking , and cultivating . If you have a planting of half an acre or more you may want to buy a small garden tractor ( available for $300 to $500 with attachments , 1960 prices ) . These tractors are not entirely satisfactory for plowing , particularly on heavier soils , so you may still want to hire someone to do the plowing . Cost of power and machinery is often a serious problem to the small-scale farmer . If you are going to farm for extra cash income on a part-time basis you must keep in mind the needed machinery investments when you choose among farm enterprises . You can keep your machinery investment down by buying good secondhand machinery , by sharing the cost and upkeep of machinery with a neighbor , and by hiring someone with machinery to do certain jobs . If an expensive and specialized piece of machinery is needed -- such as a spray rig , a combine , or a binder -- it is better to pay someone with a machine to do the work . Selecting a farm Before you look for a farm you'll need to know ( 1 ) the kind and scale of farming you want to undertake ; ; and ( 2 ) whether you want to buy or rent . Information on pages 8 to 14 may help you in deciding on the kind and scale of your farming venture . If you are not well acquainted with the area in which you wish to locate , or if you are not sure that you and your family will like and make a success of farming , usually you would do better to rent a place for a year or two before you buy . Discussed below are some of the main things to look for when you select a part-time farm . Location nearness to work . -- Choose a location within easy commuting distance of both the regular job and other employment opportunities . Then if you change jobs you won't necessarily have to sell the farm . The presence of alternative job opportunities also will make the place easier to sell if that should become desirable . Obviously the farm should be on an all-weather road . Nearness to markets . -- If you grow anything to sell you will need markets nearby . If you plan to sell fresh vegetables or whole milk , for example , you should be close to a town or city . Kind of neighborhood . -- Look for a farm in a neighborhood of well-kept homes . There are slums in the country as well as in the city . Few rural areas are protected by zoning . A tavern , filling station , junk yard , rendering plant , or some other business may go up near enough to hurt your home or to hurt its value . Facilities in the area . -- Check on the schools in the area , the quality of teaching , and the provision for transportation to and from them . Find out whether fire protection , sewage system , gas , water mains , and electrical lines are available in the locality . If these facilities are not at the door , getting them may cost more than you expect . You may have to provide them yourself or get along without them . You cannot get along without an adequate supply of pure water . If you are considering a part-time farm where the water must be provided by a well , find out if there is a good well on the farm or the probable cost of having one drilled . A pond may provide adequate water for livestock and garden . Pond water can be filtered for human use , but most part-time farmers would not want to go to so much trouble . The following amounts of water are needed per day for livestock and domestic uses . Topography and soil Is the land suited to the crops you intend to raise ? If you can't tell , get help from your county agricultural agent or other local specialist . Soil type , drainage , or degree of slope can make the difference between good crops and poor ones . Small areas that aren't right for a certain crop may lie next to areas that are well suited to that crop . The house Will the house on any part-time farm you are considering make a satisfactory full-time residence ? How much will it cost to do any necessary modernizing and redecorating ? If the house is not wired adequately for electricity or if plumbing or a central heating system must be installed , check into the cost of making these improvements . Buying a farm The value of the farm to you will depend on -- Its worth as a place to live . The value of the products you can raise on it . The possibilities of selling the property later on for suburban subdivision . Decide first what the place is worth to you and your family as a home in comparison with what it would cost to live in town . Take into account the difference in city and county taxes , insurance rates , utility rates , and the cost of travel to work . Next , estimate the value of possible earnings of the farm . To do this , set up a plan on paper for operating the farm . List the kind and quantity of things the farm can be expected to produce in an average year . Estimate the value of the produce at normal prices . The total is the probably gross income from farming . To find estimated net farm income , subtract estimated annual farming expenditures from probable gross income from farming . Include as expenditures an allowance for depreciation of farm buildings and equipment . Also count as an expense a charge for the labor to be contributed by the family . It may be hard to decide what this labor is worth , but charge something for it . Otherwise , you may pay too much for the farm and get nothing for your labor . To figure the value of the farm in terms of investment income , divide the estimated annual net farm income by the percentage that you could expect to get in interest if the money were invested in some other way . Everyone with a personal or group tragedy to relate had to be given his day in court as in some vast collective dirge . For almost two months , the defendant and the world heard from individuals escaped from the grave about fathers and mothers , graybeards , adolescents , babies , starved , beaten to death , strangled , machine-gunned , gassed , burned . One who had been a boy in Auschwitz had to tell how children had been selected by height for the gas chambers . The gruesome humor of the Nazis was not forgotten -- the gas chamber with a sign on it with the name of a Jewish foundation and bearing a copper Star of David -- nor the gratuitous sadism of SS officers . Public relations strategists everywhere , watching the reaction of the German press , the liberal press , the lunatic-fringe press , listening to their neighbors , studying interviews with men and women on the street , cried out : Too much , too much -- the mind of the audience is becoming dulled , the horrors are losing their effect . And still another witness , one who had crawled out from under a heap of corpses , had to tell how the victims had been forced to lay themselves head to foot one on top of the other before being shot . Most of this testimony may have been legally admissible as bearing on the corpus delicti of the total Nazi crime but seemed subject to question when not tied to the part in it of the defendant's Department of Jewish Affairs . Counsel for the defense , however , shrewdly allowing himself to be swept by the current of dreadful recollections , rarely raised an objection . Would not the emotional catharsis eventually brought on by this awfulness have a calming , if not exhausting , effect likely to improve his client's chances ? Those who feared `` emotionalism '' at the Trial showed less understanding than Dr. Servatius of the route by which man achieves the distance necessary for fairness toward enemies . Interruptions came largely from the bench , which numerous times rebuked the Attorney General for letting his witnesses run on , though it , too , made no serious effort to choke off the flow . But there was a contrast even more decisive than a hunger for fact between the Trial in Jerusalem and those in Moscow and New York . In each of the last , the trial marked the beginning of a new course : in Moscow the liquidation of the Old Bolsheviks and the tightening of Stalin's dictatorship ; ; in the United States the initiation of militant anti-Communism , with the repentant ex-Communist in the vanguard . These trials were properly termed `` political cases '' in that the trial itself was a political act producing political consequences . But what could the Eichmann Trial initiate ? Of what new course could it mark the beginning ? The Eichmann case looked to the past , not to the future . It was the conclusion of the first phase of a process of tragic recollection , and of refining the recollection , that will last as long as there are Jews . As such , it was beyond politics and had no need of justification by a `` message '' . `` It is not an individual that is in the dock at this historical trial '' -- said Ben Gurion , `` and not the Nazi regime alone -- but anti-Semitism throughout history '' . How could supplying Eichmann with a platform on which to maintain that one could collaborate in the murder of millions of Jews without being an anti-semite contribute to a verdict against anti-Semitism ? And if it was not an individual who was in the dock , why was the Trial , as we shall observe later , all but scuttled in the attempt to prove Eichmann a `` fiend '' ? These questions touch the root of confusion in the prosecution's case . It might be contended , of course , that Eichmann in stubbornly denying anti-Semitic feelings was lying or insisting on a private definition of anti-Semitism . But in either event he was the wrong man for the kind of case outlined by Ben Gurion and set forth in the indictment . In such a case the defendant should serve as a clear example and not have to be tied to the issue by argument . One who could be linked to anti-Semitism only by overcoming his objections is scarcely a good specimen of the Jew-baiter throughout the ages . Shout at Eichmann though he might , the Prosecutor could not establish that the defendant was falsifying the way he felt about Jews or that what he did feel fell into the generally recognized category of anti-Semitism . Yes , he believed that the Jews were `` enemies of the Reich '' , and such a belief is , of course , typical of `` patriotic '' anti-Semites ; ; but he believed in the Jew-as-enemy in a kind of abstract , theological way , like a member of a cult speculating on the nature of things . The real question was how one passed from anti-Semitism of this sort to murder , and the answer to this question is not to be found in anti-Semitism itself . In regard to Eichmann , it was to be found in the Nazi outlook , which contained a principle separate from and far worse than anti-Semitism , a principle by which the poison of anti-Semitism itself was made more virulent . Perhaps under the guidance of this Nazi principle one could , as Eichmann declared , feel personally friendly toward the Jews and still be their murderer . Not through fear of disobeying orders , as Eichmann kept trying to explain , but through a peculiar giddiness that began in a half-acceptance of the vicious absurdities contained in the Nazi interpretation of history and grew with each of Hitler's victories into a permanent light-mindedness and sense of magical rightness that was able to respond to any proposal , and the more outrageous the better , `` Well , let's try it '' . At any rate , the substance of Eichmann's testimony was that all his actions flowed from his membership in the party and the SS , and though the Prosecutor did his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of Jews , his success on this score was doubtful and the anti-Semitic lesson weakened to that extent . But if the Trial did not expose the special Nazi mania so deadly to Jews as well as to anyone upon whom it happened to light , neither did it warn very effectively against the ordinary anti-Semitism of which the Nazis made such effective use in Germany and wherever else they could find it . If anti-Semitism was on trial in Jerusalem , why was it not identified , and with enough emphasis to capture the notice of the world press , in its connection with the activities of Eichmann's Department of Jewish Affairs , as exemplified by the betrayal and murder of Jews by non-police and non-party anti-Semites in Germany , as well as in Poland , Czechoslovakia , Hungary ? The infamous Wansee Conference called by Heydrich in January 1942 , to organize the material and technical means to put to death the eleven million Jews spread throughout the nations of Europe , was attended by representatives of major organs of the German state , including the Reich Minister of the Interior , the State Secretary in charge of the Four Year Plan , the Reich Minister of Justice , the Under Secretary of Foreign Affairs . The measures for annihilation proposed and accepted at the Conference affected industry , transportation , civilian agencies of government . Heydrich , in opening the Conference , followed the reasoning and even the phraseology of the order issued earlier by Goering which authorized the Final Solution as `` a complement to '' previous `` solutions '' for eliminating the Jews from German living space through violence , economic strangulation , forced emigration , and evacuation . In other words , the promulgators of the murder plan made clear that physically exterminating the Jews was but an extension of the anti-Semitic measures already operating in every phase of German life , and that the new conspiracy counted on the general anti-Semitism that had made those measures effective , as a readiness for murder . This , in fact , it turned out to be . Since the magnitude of the plan made secrecy impossible , once the wheels had began to turn , persons controlling German industries , social institutions , and armed forces became , through their anti-Semitism or their tolerance of it , conscious accomplices of Hitler's crimes ; ; whether in the last degree or a lesser one was a matter to be determined individually . What more could be asked for a Trial intended to warn the world against anti-Semitism than this opportunity to expose the exact link between the respectable Anti-Semite and the concentration-camp brute ? Not in Eichmann's anti-Semitism but in the anti-Semitism of the sober German man of affairs lay the potential warning of the Trial . No doubt many of the citizens of the Third Reich had conceived their anti-Semitism as an `` innocent '' dislike of Jews , as do others like them today . The Final Solution proved that the Jew-baiter of any variety exposes himself as being implicated in the criminality and madness of others . Ought not an edifying Trial have made every effort to demonstrate this once and for all by showing how representative types of `` mere '' anti-Semites were drawn step by step into the program of skull-bashings and gassings ? The Prosecutor in his opening remarks did refer to `` the germ of anti-Semitism '' among the Germans which Hitler `` stimulated and transformed '' . But if there was evidence at the Trial that aimed over Eichmann's head at his collaborators in the societies where he functioned , the press seems to have missed it . Nor did the Trial devote much attention to exposing the usefulness of anti-Semitism to the Nazis , both in building their own power and in destroying that of rival organizations and states . Certainly , one of the best ways of warning the world against anti-Semitism is to demonstrate its workings as a dangerous weapon . Eichmann himself is a model of how the myth of the enemy-Jew can be used to transform the ordinary man of present-day society into a menace to all his neighbors . Do patriots everywhere know enough about how the persecution of the Jews in Germany and later in the occupied countries contributed to terrorizing the populations , splitting apart individuals and groups , arousing the meanest and most dishonest impulses , pulverizing trust and personal dignity , and finally forcing people to follow their masters into the abyss by making them partners in unspeakable crimes ? The career of Eichmann made the Trial a potential showcase for anti-Semitic demoralization : fearful of being mistaken for a Jew , he seeks protection in his Nazi uniform ; ; clinging to the enemy-Jew idea , he is forced to overcome habits of politeness and neighborliness ; ; once in power he begins to give vent to a criminal opportunism that causes him to alternate between megalomania and envy of those above him . `` Is this the type of citizen you desire '' ? The Trial should have asked the nations . But though this characterization in no way diminished Eichmann's guilt , the Prosecutor , more deeply involved in the tactics of a criminal case than a political one , would have none of it . Finally , if the mission of the Trial was to convict anti-Semitism , how could it have failed to post before the world the contrasting fates of the countries in which the Final Solution was aided by native Jew-haters -- i.e. , Germany , Poland , Hungary , Czechoslovakia -- and those in which it met the obstacle of human solidarity -- Denmark , Holland , Italy , Bulgaria , France ? Should not everyone have been awakened to it as an outstanding fact of our time that the nations poisoned by anti-Semitism proved less fortunate in regard to their own freedom than those whose citizens saved their Jewish compatriots from the transports ? Wasn't this meaning of Eichmann's experience in various countries worth highlighting ? As the first collective confrontation of the Nazi outrage , the Trial of Eichmann represents a recovery of the Jews from the shock of the death camps , a recovery that took fifteen years and which is still by no means complete ( though let no one believe that it could be hastened by silence ) . Only across a distance of time could the epic accounting begin . It is already difficult to recall how little we knew before the Trial of what had been done to the Jews of Europe . It is not that the facts of the persecution were unavailable ; ; most of the information elicited in Jerusalem had been brought to the surface by the numerous War Crimes tribunals and investigating commissions , and by reports , memoirs , and survivors' accounts . In Poughkeepsie , N.Y. , , in 1952 , a Roman Catholic hospital presented seven Protestant physicians with an ultimatum to quit the Planned Parenthood Federation or to resign from the hospital staff . Three agreed , but four declined and were suspended . After a flood of protests , they were reinstated at the beginning of 1953 . The peace of the community was badly disturbed , and people across the nation , reading of the incident , felt uneasy . In New York City in 1958 , the city's Commissioner of Hospitals refused to permit a physician to provide a Protestant mother with a contraceptive device . He thereby precipitated a bitter controversy involving Protestants , Jews and Roman Catholics that continued for two months , until the city's Board of Hospitals lifted the ban on birth-control therapy . A year later in Albany , N.Y. , a Roman Catholic hospital barred an orthopedic surgeon because of his connection with the Planned Parenthood Association . Immediately , the religious groups of the city were embroiled in an angry dispute over the alleged invasion of a man's right to freedom of religious belief and conscience . These incidents , typical of many others , dramatize the distressing fact that no controversy during the last several decades has caused more tension , rancor and strife among religious groups in this country than the birth-control issue . It has flared up periodically on the front pages of newspapers in communities divided over birth-prevention regulations in municipal hospitals and health and family-welfare agencies . It has erupted on the national level in the matter of including birth-control information and material in foreign aid to underdeveloped countries . Where it is not actually erupting , it rumbles and smolders in sullen resentment like a volcano , ready to explode at any moment . The time has come for citizens of all faiths to unite in an effort to remove this divisive and nettlesome issue from the political and social life of our nation . The first step toward the goal is the establishment of a new atmosphere of mutual good will and friendly communication on other than the polemical level . Instead of emotional recrimination , loaded phrases and sloganeering , we need a dispassionate study of the facts , a better understanding of the opposite viewpoint and a more serious effort to extend the areas of agreement until a solution is reached . `` All too frequently '' , points out James O'Gara , managing editor of Commonweal , `` Catholics run roughshod over Protestant sensibilities in this matter , by failure to consider the reasoning behind the Protestant position and , particularly , by their jibes at the fact that Protestant opinion on birth control has changed in recent decades '' . All too often our language is unduly harsh . The second step is to recognize the substantial agreement -- frequently blurred by emotionalism and inaccurate newspaper reporting -- already existing between Catholics and Non-Catholics concerning the over-all objectives of family planning . Instead of Catholics' being obliged or even encouraged to beget the greatest possible number of offspring , as many Non-Catholics imagine , the ideal of responsible parenthood is stressed . Family planning is encouraged , so that parents will be able to provide properly for their offspring . Pope Pius 12 , declared in 1951 that it is possible to be exempt from the normal obligation of parenthood for a long time and even for the whole duration of married life , if there are serious reasons , such as those often mentioned in the so-called medical , eugenic , economic and social `` indications '' . This means that such factors as the health of the parents , particularly the mother , their ability to provide their children with the necessities of life , the degree of population density of a country and the shortage of housing facilities may legitimately be taken into consideration in determining the number of offspring . These are substantially the same factors considered by Non-Catholics in family planning . The laws of many states permit birth control only for medical reasons . The Roman Catholic Church , however , sanctions a much more liberal policy on family planning . Catholics , Protestants and Jews are in agreement over the objectives of family planning , but disagree over the methods to be used . The Roman Catholic Church sanctions only abstention or the rhythm method , also known as the use of the infertile or safe period . The Church considers this to be the method provided by nature and its divine Author : It involves no frustration of nature's laws , but simply an intelligent and disciplined use of them . With the exception of the Roman Catholic and the Orthodox Catholic Churches , most churches make no moral distinction between rhythm and mechanical or chemical contraceptives , allowing the couple free choice . There is a difference in theological belief where there seems little chance of agreement . The grounds for the Church's position are Scriptural ( Old Testament ) , the teachings of the fathers and doctors of the early Church , the unbroken tradition of nineteen centuries , the decisions of the highest ecclesiastical authority and the natural law . The latter plays a prominent role in Roman Catholic theology and is considered decisive , entirely apart from Scripture , in determining the ethical character of birth-prevention methods . The Roman Catholic natural-law tradition regards as self-evident that the primary objective purpose of the conjugal act is procreation and that the fostering of the mutual love of the spouses is the secondary and subjective end . This conclusion is based on two propositions : that man by the use of his reason can ascertain God's purpose in the universe and that God makes known His purpose by certain `` given '' physical arrangements . Thus , man can readily deduce that the primary objective end of the conjugal act is procreation , the propagation of the race . Moreover , man may not supplant or frustrate the physical arrangements established by God , who through the law of rhythm has provided a natural method for the control of conception . Believing that God is the Author of this law and of all laws of nature , Roman Catholics believe that they are obliged to obey those laws , not frustrate or mock them . Let it be granted then that the theological differences in this area between Protestants and Roman Catholics appear to be irreconcilable . But people differ in their religious beliefs on scores of doctrines , without taking up arms against those who disagree with them . Why is it so different in regard to birth control ? It is because each side has sought to implement its distinctive theological belief through legislation and thus indirectly force its belief , or at least the practical consequences thereof , upon others . It is always a temptation for a religious organization , especially a powerful or dominant one , to impose through the clenched fist of the law its creedal viewpoint upon others . Both Roman Catholics and Protestants have succumbed to this temptation in the past . Consider what happened during World War 1 , , when the Protestant churches united to push the Prohibition law through Congress . Many of them sincerely believe that the use of liquor in any form or in any degree is intrinsically evil and sinful . With over four million American men away at war , Protestants forced their distinctive theological belief upon the general public . With the return of our soldiers , it soon became apparent that the belief was not shared by the great majority of citizens . The attempt to enforce that belief ushered in a reign of bootleggers , racketeers , hijackers and gangsters that led to a breakdown of law unparalleled in our history . The so-called `` noble experiment '' came to an inglorious end . That tumultuous , painful and costly experience shows clearly that a law expressing a moral judgment cannot be enforced when it has little correspondence with the general view of society . That experience holds a lesson for us all in regard to birth control today . Up to the turn of the century , contraception was condemned by all Christian churches as immoral , unnatural and contrary to divine law . This was generally reflected in the civil laws of Christian countries . Today , the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches stand virtually alone in holding that conviction . The various Lambeth Conferences , expressing the Anglican viewpoint , mirror the gradual change that has taken place among Protestants generally . In 1920 , the Lambeth Conference repeated its 1908 condemnation of contraception and issued `` an emphatic warning against the use of unnatural means for the avoidance of conception , together with the grave dangers -- physical , moral , and religious -- thereby incurred , and against the evils which the extension of such use threaten the race '' . Denouncing the view that the sexual union is an end in itself , the Conference declared : `` We steadfastly uphold what must always be regarded as the governing considerations of Christian marriage . One is the primary purpose for which marriage exists , namely , the continuance of the race through the gift and heritage of children ; ; the other is the paramount importance in married life of deliberate and thoughtful self-control '' . The Conference called for a vigorous campaign against the open or secret sale of contraceptives . In 1930 , the Lambeth Conference again affirmed the primary purpose of marriage to be the procreation of children , but conceded that , in certain limited circumstances , contraception might be morally legitimate . In 1958 , the Conference endorsed birth control as the responsibility laid by God on parents everywhere . Many other Protestant denominations preceded the Anglicans in such action . In March , 1931 , 22 out of 28 members of a committee of the Federal Council of Churches ratified artificial methods of birth control . `` As to the necessity '' , the committee declared , `` for some form of effective control of the size of the family and the spacing of children , and consequently of control of conception , there can be no question . There is general agreement also that sex union between husbands and wives as an expression of mutual affection without relation to procreation is right '' . Since then , many Protestant denominations have made separate pronouncements , in which they not only approved birth control , but declared it at times to be a religious duty . What determines the morality , they state , is not the means used , but the motive In general , the means ( excluding abortion ) that prove most effective are considered the most ethical . This development is reflected in the action taken in February , 1961 , by the general board of the National Council of Churches , the largest Protestant organization in the Aj . The board approved and commended the use of birth-control devices as a part of Christian responsibility in family planning . It called for opposition to laws and institutional practices restricting the information or availability of contraceptives . The general board declared : `` Most of the Protestant churches hold contraception and periodic continence to be morally right when the motives are right . The general Protestant conviction is that motives , rather than methods , form the primary moral issue , provided the methods are limited to the prevention of conception '' . An action once universally condemned by all Christian churches and forbidden by the civil law is now not only approved by the overwhelming majority of Protestant denominations , but also deemed , at certain times , to be a positive religious duty . This viewpoint has now been translated into action by the majority of people in this country . Repeated polls have disclosed that most married couples are now using contraceptives in the practice of birth control . For all concerned with social-welfare legislation , the significance of this radical and revolutionary change in the thought and habits of the vast majority of the American people is clear , profound and far-reaching . To try to oppose the general religious and moral conviction of such a majority by a legislative fiat would be to invite the same breakdown of law and order that was occasioned by the ill-starred Prohibition experiment . This brings us to the fact that the realities we are dealing with lie not in the field of civil legislation , but in the realm of conscience and religion : They are moral judgments and matters of theological belief . Conscience and religion are concerned with private sin : The civil law is concerned with public crimes . Only confusion , failure and anarchy result when the effort is made to impose upon the civil authority the impossible task of policing private homes to preclude the possibility of sin . Among the chief victims of such an ill-conceived imposition would be religion itself . On April 17 , 1610 , the sturdy little three-masted bark , Discovery , weighed anchor in St. Katherine's Pool , London , and floated down the Thames toward the sea . She carried , besides her captain , a crew of twenty-one and provisions for a voyage of exploration of the Arctic waters of North America . Seventeen months later , on September 6 , 1611 , an Irish fishing boat sighted the Discovery limping eastward outside Galway Bay . When she reached port , she was found to have on board only eight men , all near starvation . The captain was gone , and the mate was gone . The man who now commanded her had started the voyage as an ordinary seaman . What disaster struck the Discovery during those seventeen months ? What happened to the fourteen missing men ? These questions have remained one of the great sea mysteries of all time . For hundreds of years , the evidence available consisted of ( 1 ) the captain's fragmentary journal , ( 2 ) a highly prejudiced account by one of the survivors , ( 3 ) a note found in a dead man's desk on board , and ( 4 ) several second-hand reports . All told , they offered a highly confused picture . But since 1927 , researchers digging into ancient court records and legal files have been able to find illuminating pieces of information . Not enough to do away with all doubts , but sufficient to give a fairly accurate picture of the events of the voyage . Historians have had two reasons for persisting so long in their investigations . First , they wanted to clarify a tantalizing , bizarre enigma . Second , they believed it important to determine the fate of the captain -- a man whose name is permanently stamped on our maps , on American towns and counties , on a great American river , and on half a million square miles of Arctic seas . The name : Henry Hudson . This is the story of his last tragic voyage , as nearly as we are able -- or ever , probably , will be able -- to determine : The sailing in the spring of 1610 was Hudson's fourth in four years . Each time his objective had been the same -- a direct water passage from Western Europe to the Far East . In 1607 and 1608 , the English Muscovy Company had sent him northward to look for a route over the North Pole or across the top of Russia . Twice he had failed , and the Muscovy Company indicated it would not back him again . In 1609 , the Dutch East India Company hired Hudson , gave him two learned geographers , fitted him out with a ship called the Half Moon , and supplied him with Dutch sailors . This time he turned westward , to the middle Atlantic coast of North America . His chief discovery was important -- the Great North ( later , the Hudson ) River -- but it produced no northwest passage . When the Half Moon put in at Dartmouth , England , in the fall of 1609 , word of Hudson's findings leaked out , and English interest in him revived . The government forbade Hudson to return to Amsterdam with his ship . He thereupon went to London and spent the winter talking to men of wealth . By springtime , he was supported by a rich merchant syndicate under the patronage of Henry , Prince of Wales . He had obtained and provisioned a veteran ship called the Discovery and had recruited a crew of twenty-one , the largest he had ever commanded . The purpose of this fourth voyage was clear . A century of exploration had established that a great land mass , North and South America , lay between Europe and the Indies . One by one , the openings in the coast that promised a passage through had been explored and discarded . In fact , Hudson's sail up the Great North River had disposed of one of the last hopes . But there remained one mysterious , unexplored gap , far to the north . Nearly twenty-five years before , Captain John Davis had noted , as he sailed near the Arctic Circle , `` a very great gulf , the water whirling and roaring , as it were the meeting of tides '' . He named this opening , between Baffin Island and Labrador , the `` Furious Overfall '' . ( Later , it was to be called Hudson Strait . ) In 1602 , George Waymouth , in the same little Discovery that Hudson now commanded , had sailed 300 miles up the strait before his frightened men turned the ship back . Hudson now proposed to sail all the way through and test the seas beyond for the long-sought waterway . Even Hudson , experienced in Arctic sailing and determined as he was , must have had qualms as he slid down the Thames . Ahead were perilous , ice-filled waters . On previous voyages , it had been in precisely such dangerous situations that he had failed as a leader and captain . On the second voyage , he had turned back at the frozen island of Novaya Zemlya and meekly given the crew a certificate stating that he did so of his own free will -- which was obviously not the case . On the third voyage , a near-mutiny rising from a quarrel between Dutch and English crew members on the Half Moon had almost forced him to head the ship back to Amsterdam in Mid-Atlantic . Worse , his present crew included five men who had sailed with him before . Of only one could he be sure -- young John Hudson , his second son . The mate , Robert Juet , who had kept the journal on the Half Moon , was experienced -- but he was a bitter old man , ready to complain or desert at any opportunity . Philip Staffe , the ship's carpenter , was a good worker , but perversely independent . Arnold Lodley and Michael Perse were like the rest -- lukewarm , ready to swing against Hudson in a crisis . But men willing to sail at all into waters where wooden ships could be crushed like eggs were hard to find . Hudson knew he had to use these men as long as he remained an explorer . And he refused to be anything else . It is believed that Hudson was related to other seafaring men of the Muscovy Company and was trained on company ships . He was a Londoner , married , with three sons . ( The common misconception that he was Dutch and that his first name was Hendrik stem from Dutch documents of his third voyage . ) In 1610 , Hudson was probably in his early forties , a good navigator , a stubborn voyager , but otherwise fatally unsuited to his chosen profession . Hudson's first error of the fourth voyage occurred only a few miles down the Thames . There at the river's edge waited one Henry Greene , whom Hudson listed as a `` clerk '' . Greene was in actuality a young ruffian from Kent , who had broken with his parents in order to keep the company he preferred -- pimps , panders and whores . He was not the sort of sailor Hudson wanted his backers to see on board and he had Greene wait at Gravesend , where the Discovery picked him up . For the first three weeks , the ship skirted up the east coast of Great Britain , then turned westward . On May 11 , she reached Iceland . Poor winds and fog locked her up in a harbor the crew called `` Lousie Bay '' . The subsequent two-weeks wait made the crew quarrelsome . With Hudson looking on , his protege Greene picked a fight with the ship's surgeon , Edward Wilson . The issue was settled on shore , Greene winning and Wilson remaining ashore , determined to catch the next fishing boat back to England . With difficulty , Hudson persuaded him to rejoin the ship , and they sailed from Iceland . Early in June , the Discovery passed `` Desolation '' ( southern Greenland ) and in mid-June entered the `` Furious Overfall '' . Floating ice bore down from the north and west . Fog hung over the route constantly . Turbulent tides rose as much as fifty feet . The ship's compass was useless because of the nearness of the magnetic North Pole . As the bergs grew larger , Hudson was forced to turn south into what is now Ungava Bay , an inlet of the Great Strait . After finding that its coasts led nowhere , however , he turned north again , toward the main , ice-filled passageway -- and the crew , at first uneasy , then frightened , rebelled . The trouble was at least partly Juet's doing . For weeks he had been saying that Hudson's idea of sailing through to Java was absurd . The great , crushing ice masses coming into view made him sound like the voice of pure reason . A group of sailors announced to Hudson that they would sail no farther . Instead of quelling the dissension , as many captains of the era would have done ( Sir Francis Drake lopped a man's head off under similar circumstances ) , Hudson decided to be reasonable . He went to his cabin and emerged carrying a large chart , which he set up in view of the crew . Patiently , he explained what he knew about their course and their objectives . When Hudson had finished , the `` town meeting '' broke down into a general , wordy argument . One man remarked that if he had a hundred pounds , he would give ninety of them to be back in England . Up spoke carpenter Staffe , who said he wouldn't give ten pounds to be home . The statement was effective . The meeting broke up . Hudson was free to sail on . All through July the Discovery picked her way along the 450-mile-long strait , avoiding ice and rocky islands . On August 3 , two massive headlands reared out of the mists -- great gateways never before , so far as Hudson knew , seen by Europeans . To starboard was a cape a thousand feet high , patched with ice and snow , populated by thousands of screaming sea birds . To port was a point 200 feet high rising behind to a precipice of 2,000 feet . Hudson named the capes Digges and Wolstenholme , for two of his backers . Hudson pointed the Discovery down the east coast of the newly discovered sea ( now called Hudson Bay ) , confident he was on his way to the warm waters of the Pacific . After three weeks' swift sailing , however , the ship entered an area of shallow marshes and river deltas . The ship halted . The great `` sea to the westwards '' was a dead end . This must have been Hudson's blackest discovery . For he seemed to sense at once that before him was no South Sea , but the solid bulk of the North American continent . This was the bitter end , and Hudson seemed to know he was destined to failure . Feverishly , he tried to brush away this intuition . North and south , east and west , back and forth he sailed in the land-locked bay , plowing furiously forward until land appeared , then turning to repeat the process , day after day , week after week . Hundreds of miles to the north , the route back to England through the `` Furious Overfall '' was again filling with ice . The men were at first puzzled , then angered by the aimless tacking . Once more , Juet's complaints were the loudest . Hudson's reply was to accuse the mate of disloyalty . Juet demanded that Hudson prove his charges in an open trial . The trial was held September 10 . Hudson , presiding , heard Juet's defense , then called for testimony from crew members . Juet had made plentiful enemies , several men stepped forward . Hands on Bible , seaman Lodley and carpenter Staffe swore that Juet had tried to persuade them to keep muskets and swords in their cabins . Cook Bennett Mathues said Juet had predicted bloodshed on the ship . Others added that Juet had wanted to turn the ship homeward . Hudson deposed Juet and cut his pay . The new mate was Robert Bylot , talented but inexperienced . There were other shifts and pay cuts according to the way individuals had conducted themselves . The important result , however , was that Juet and Francis Clemens , the deposed boatswain , became Hudson's sworn enemies . As Hudson resumed his desperate criss-crossing of the little bay , every incident lessened the crew's respect for him . Once , after the Discovery lay for a week in rough weather , Hudson ordered the anchor raised before the sea had calmed . Just as it was being hauled inboard , a sea hit the ship . Michael Butt and Adame Moore were thrown off the capstan and badly injured . The anchor cable would have been lost overboard , but Philip Staffe was on hand to sever it with his axe . Thomas Douglas , fifth Earl of Selkirk , a noble humanitarian Scot concerned with the plight of the crofters of his native Highlands , conceived a plan to settle them in the valley of the Red River of the North . Since the land he desired lay within the great northern empire of the Hudson's Bay Company , he purchased great blocks of the Comany's stock with the view to controlling its policies . Having achieved this end , he was able to buy 116,000 square miles in the valleys of the Red and Assiniboine rivers . The grant , which stretched southward to Lake Traverse -- the headwaters of the Red -- was made in May , 1811 , and by October of that year a small group of Scots was settling for the winter at York Factory on Hudson Bay . Thus at the same time that William Henry Harrison was preparing to pacify the aborigines of Indiana Territory and winning fame at the battle of Tippecanoe , Anglo-Saxon settlement made a great leap into the center of the North American continent to the west of the American agricultural frontier . Seven hundred miles south of York Factory , at `` the Forks '' of the Red and the Assiniboine , twenty-three men located a settlement in August 1812 . By October the little colony about Fort Douglas ( present-day Winnipeg ) numbered 100 . Within a few years the Scots , engaged in breaking the thick sod and stirring the rich soil of the valley , were joined by a group called Meurons . The latter , members of two regiments of Swiss mercenaries transported by Great Britain to Canada to fight the Americans in the War of 1812 , had settled in Montreal and Kingston at the close of the war in 1815 . Selkirk persuaded eighty men and four officers to go to Red River where they were to serve as a military force to protect his settlers from the hostile Northwest Company which resented the intrusion of farmers into the fur traders' empire . The mercenaries were little interested in farming and added nothing to the output of the farm plots on which all work was still done with hoes as late as 1818 . It was the low yield of the Selkirk plots and the ravages of grasshoppers in 1818 that led to the dispersal of the settlement southward . When late in the summer the full extent of the damage was assessed , all but fifty of the Scots , Swiss and metis moved up the Red to the mouth of the Pembina river . Here they built huts and a stockade named Fort Daer after Selkirk's barony in Scotland . The new site was somewhat warmer than Fort Douglas and much closer to the great herds of buffalo on which the settlement must depend for food . The Selkirk settlers had been anticipated in their move southward by British fur traders . For many years the Northwest Company had its southern headquarters at Prairie Du Chien on the Mississippi River , some 300 miles southeast of present-day St. Paul , Minnesota . When in 1816 an act of Congress forced the foreign firm out of the United States , its British-born employees , now become American citizens -- Joseph Rolette , Joseph Renville and Alexis Bailly -- continued in the fur business . On Big Stone Lake near the headwaters of the Red River , Robert Dickson , Superintendent of the Western Indian Department of Canada , had a trading post and planned in 1818 to build a fort to be defended by twenty men and two small artillery pieces . His trading goods came from Canada to the Forks of Red River and from Selkirk's settlement he brought them south in carts . These carts were of a type devised in Pembina in the days of Alexander Henry the Younger about a decade before the Selkirk colony was begun . In 1802 Henry referred to `` our new carts '' as being about four feet off the ground and carrying five times as much as a horse could pack . They were held together by pegs and withes and in later times drawn by a single ox in thills . It was Dickson who suggested to Lord Selkirk that he return to the Atlantic coast by way of the United States . In September 1817 at Fort Daer ( Pembina ) Dickson met the noble lord whom , with the help of a band of Sioux , he escorted to Prairie Du Chien . During the trip Selkirk decided that the route through Illinois territory to Indiana and the eastern United States was the best route for goods from England to reach Red River and that the United States was a better source of supply for many goods than either Canada or England . Upon arriving at Baltimore , Selkirk on December 22 wrote to John Quincy Adams , Secretary of State at Washington , inquiring about laws covering trade with `` Missouri and Illinois Territories '' . This traffic , he declared prophetically , `` tho' it might be of small account at first , would increase with the progress of our Settlements . '' The route which he had traveled and which he believed might develop into a trade route was followed by his settlers earlier than he might have expected . In 1819 grasshoppers again destroyed the crop at `` the Forks '' ( Fort Douglas ) and in December 1819 , twenty men left Fort Daer for the most northerly American outpost at Prairie Du Chien . It was a three-month journey in the dead of winter followed by three months of labor on Mackinac boats . With these completed and ice gone from the St. Peter's River ( present-day Minnesota river ) their 250 bushels of wheat , 100 bushels of oats and barley and 30 bushels of peas and some chickens were loaded onto the flat-bottomed boats and rowed up the river to Big Stone Lake , across into Lake Traverse , and down the Red . They reached Fort Douglas in June 1820 . This epic effort to secure seed for the colony cost Selkirk Ab1,040 . Nevertheless so short was the supply of seed that the settlers were forced to retreat to Fort Daer for food . Thereafter seed and food became more plentiful and the colony remained in the north the year round . Activity by British traders and the presence of a colony on the Red prompted the United State War Department in 1819 to send Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Leavenworth from Detroit to put a post 300 miles northwest of Prairie Du Chien , until then the most advanced United States post . In September 1822 two companies of infantry arrived at the mouth of the St. Peter's River , the head of navigation on the Mississippi , and began construction of Fort St. Anthony which , upon completion , was renamed in honor of its commander , Colonel Josiah Snelling . It was from the American outposts that Red River shortages of livestock were to be made good . Hercules L. Dousman , fur trader and merchant at Prairie Du Chien , contracted to supply Selkirk's people with some 300 head of cattle , and Alexis Bailly and Francois Labothe were hired as drovers . Bailly , after leaving Fort Snelling in August 1821 , was forced to leave some of the cattle at the Hudson's Bay Company's post on Lake Traverse `` in the Sieux Country '' and reached Fort Garry , as the Selkirk Hudson's Bay Company center was now called , late in the fall . He set out on his 700-mile return journey with five families of discontented and disappointed Swiss who turned their eyes toward the United States . Observing their distressing condition , Colonel Snelling allowed these half-starved immigrants to settle on the military reservation . As these Swiss were moving from the Selkirk settlement to become the first civilian residents of Minnesota , Dousman of Michilimackinac , Michigan , and Prairie Du Chien was traveling to Red River to open a trade in merchandise . Early in 1822 he was at Fort Garry offering to bring in pork , flour , liquor and tobacco . Alexander McDonnell , governor of Red River , and James Bird , a chief factor of the Hudson's Bay Company , ordered such `` sundry articles '' to a value of Ab4,500 . For its part the Hudson's Bay Company was troubled by the approach of American settlement . As the time drew near for the drawing of the British-American frontier by terms of the agreement of 1818 , the company suspected that the Pembina colony -- its own post and Fort Daer -- was on American territory . Accordingly Selkirk's agents ordered the settlers to move north , and by October , John Halkett had torn down both posts , floating the timber to `` the Forks '' in rafts . `` I have done everything '' , he wrote , `` to break up the whole of that unfortunate establishment . '' Despite Company threats , duly carried through , to cut off supplies of powder , ball , and thread for fishing nets , about 350 persons stayed in the village . They would attempt to bring supplies from St. Louis or Prairie Du Chien at `` great expense as well as danger '' . At Fort Garry some of the Swiss also decided to cast their lot with the United States , and in 1823 several families paid guides to take them to Fort Snelling . The disasters of 1825-1826 caused more to leave . After heavy rains and an onslaught of mice , snow fell on October 15 , 1825 , and remained on the ground through a winter so cold that the ice on the Red was five feet thick . In April came a rapid thaw that produced high waters which did not recede until mid-June . On June 24 more than 400 families started the three-month trip across the plains to the Mississippi . By fall , 443 survivors of this arduous journey were clustered about Fort Snelling , but most of them were sent on to Galena and St. Louis , with a few going as far as Vevay , Indiana , a notable Swiss center in the United States . In 1837 , 157 Red River people with more than 200 cattle were living on the reservation at Fort Snelling . Below the fort , high bluffs extended uninterruptedly for six miles along the Mississippi River . At the point where they ended , another settlement grew up around a chapel built at the boat landing by Father Lucian Galtier in 1840 . Its people , including Pierre Bottineau and other American Fur Company employees and the refugees from Fort Garry , were joined by the remaining Scots and Swiss from Fort Snelling when Major Joseph Plympton expelled them from the reservation in May 1840 . The resultant town , platted in 1847 and named for the patron of Father Galtier's mission , St. Paul , was to become an important center of the fur trade and was to take on a new interest for those Selkirkers who remained at Red River . While population at Fort Garry increased rapidly , from 2,417 in 1831 to 4,369 in 1840 , economic opportunities did not increase at a similar rate . Accordingly , though the practice violated the no-trading provision of the Selkirk charter which reserved all such activity in merchandise and furs to the Hudson's Bay Company , some settlers went into trade . The Company maintained a store at which products of England could be purchased and brought in goods for the new merchants on the understanding that they refrain from trading in furs . Despite this prohibiton , by 1844 some of the Fort Garry merchants were trading with the Indians for furs . In June 1845 , the Governor and Council of Assiniboia imposed a 20 per cent duty on imports via Hudson's Bay which were viewed as aimed at the `` very vitals of the Company's trade and power '' . To reduce further the flow of goods from England , the Company's local officials asked that its London authorities refrain from forwarding any more trade goods to these men . With their customary source of supply cut off , the Fort Garry free traders engaged three men to cart goods to them from the Mississippi country . Others carried pemmican from `` the Forks '' to St. Paul and goods from St. Paul to Red River , as in the summer of 1847 when one trader , Wells , transported twenty barrels of whisky to the British settlement . This trade was subject to a tariff of 7.5 per cent after February 1835 , but much was smuggled into Assiniboia with the result that the duty was reduced by 1841 to 4 per cent on the initiative of the London committee . The trade in a few commodities noted above was to grow in volume as a result of changes both north and south of the 49th parallel . The letters of the common soldiers are rich in humor . Indeed , no richer humor is to be found in the whole of American literature than in the letters of the semi-literate men who wore the blue and the gray . Some of their figures of speech were colorful and expressive . A Confederate observed that the Yankees were : `` thicker than lise on a hen and a dam site ornraier '' . Another reported that his comrades were `` in fine spirits pitching around like a blind dog in a meat house '' . A third wrote that it was `` raining like poring peas on a rawhide '' . Yanks were equally adept at figurative expression . One wrote : `` ( I am so hungry ) I could eat a rider off his horse & snap at the stirups '' . A second reported that the dilapidated houses in Virginia `` look like the latter end of original sin and hard times '' . A third remarked of slowness of Southerners : `` they moved about from corner to corner , as uneasy as a litter of hungry leaches on the neck of a wooden god '' . Still another , annoyed by the brevity of a recently received missive , wrote : `` yore letter was short and sweet , jist like a roasted maget '' . A Yankee sergeant gave the following description of his sweetheart : `` my girl is none of your one-horse girls . She is a regular stub and twister , double geered . She is well-educated and refined , all wildcat and fur , and Union from the muzzle to the crupper '' . Humor found many modes of expression . A Texan wrote to a male companion at home : `` what has become of Halda and Laura ? When you see them again give them my love -- not best respects now , but love by God '' . William R. Stillwell , an admirable Georgian whose delightful correspondence is preserved in the Georgia Department of Archives and History , liked to tease his wife in his letters . After he had been away from home about a year he wrote : `` ( dear Wife ) if I did not write and receive letters from you I believe that I would forgit that I was married . I don't feel much like a maryed man but I never forgit it sofar as to court enny other lady but if I should you must forgive me as I am so forgitful '' . A Yank , disturbed by his increasing corpulence , wrote : `` I am growing so fat I am a burden 2 myself '' . Another Yank parodied the familiar bedtime prayer : `` now I lay me down to sleep , the gray-backs o'er my body creep ; ; if they should bite before I wake , I pray the Lord their jaws to break '' . Charles Thiot , a splendid Georgia soldier , differed from most of his comrades in the ranks in that he was the owner of a large plantation , well-educated , and nearly fifty years of age . But he was very much like his associates in his hatred of camp routine . Near the end of his service he wrote that when the war was over he was going to buy two pups , name one of them `` Fall-in '' and the other `` Close-up '' , and then shoot them both , `` and that will be the end of Fall-in and Close-up '' . The soldiers who comprised the rank and file of the Civil War armies were an earthy people . They talked and wrote much about the elemental functions of the body . One of the most common of camp maladies was diarrhoea . Men of more delicate sensibilities referred to this condition as `` looseness of the bowels '' ; ; but a much more common designation was `` the sh-ts '' . A Michigan soldier stationed in Georgia wrote in 1864 : : `` I expect to be tough as a knott as soon as I get over the Georgia Shitts '' . Johnny Rebs from the deep South who were plagued with diarrhoea after transfer to the Virginia front often informed their families that they were suffering from the `` the Virginia quickstep '' . A Georgia soldier gave his wife the following description of the cause and consequence of diarrhoea : `` I have bin a little sick with diorah two or three days . I eat too much eggs and poark . It sowered ( on ) my stomack and turn loose on me '' . A Michigan soldier wrote his brother : `` I am well at present with the exception I have got the Dyerear and I hope thease few lines find you the same '' . The letters which poured forth from camps were usually written under adverse circumstances . Save for brief periods in garrison or winter quarters , soldiers rarely enjoyed the luxury of a writing desk or table . Most of the letters were written in the hubbub of camp , on stumps , pieces of bark , drum heads , or the knee . In the South , after the first year of the war , paper and ink were very poor . Scarcity of paper caused many Southerners to adopt the practice of cross-writing , i.e. , after writing from left to right of the page in the usual manner , they gave the sheet a half turn and wrote from end to end across the lines previously written . Sometimes soldiers wrote letters while bullets were whizzing about their heads . A Yank writing from Vicksburg , May 28 , 1863 , stated : `` not less than 50 balls have passed over me since I commenced writing . I could tell you of plenty narrow escapes , but we take no notice of them now '' . A Reb stationed near Petersburg informed his mother : `` I need not tell you that I dodge pretty often for you can see that very plainly by the blots in this letter . Just count each blot a dodge and add in a few for I don't dodge every time '' . Another Reb writing under similar circumstances before Atlanta reported : `` the Yankees keep shooting so I am afraid they will knock over my ink , so I will close '' . 3 , the most common type of letter was that of soldier husbands to their wives . But fathers often addressed communications to their small children ; ; and these , full of homely advice , are among the most human and revealing of Civil War letters . Rebs who owned slaves occasionally would include in their letters admonitions or greetings to members of the Negro community . Occasionally they would write to the slaves . Early in the war it was not uncommon for planters' sons to retain in camp Negro `` body servants '' to perform the menial chores such as cooking , foraging , cleaning the quarters , shining shoes , and laundering clothes . Sometimes these servants wrote or dictated for enclosure with the letters of their soldier-masters messages to their relatives and to members of their owners' families . Unmarried soldiers carried on correspondence with sweethearts at home . Owing to the restrained usages characteristic of 19th-century America , these letters usually were stereotyped and revealed little depth of feeling . Occasionally gay young blades would write vividly to boon companions at home about their amorous exploits in Richmond , Petersburg , Washington , or Nashville . But these comments are hardly printable . An Alabama soldier whose feminine associations were of the more admirable type wrote boastfully of his achievements among the Virginia belles : `` they thout I was a saint . I told them some sweet lies and they believed it all . I would tell them I got a letter from home stating that five of my Negroes had runaway and ten of Pappy's . But I wold say I recond he did not mind it for he had a plenty more left and then they would lean to me like a sore eyd kitten to a basin of milk '' . Some of the letters were pungently expressive . An Ohio soldier who , from a comrade just returned from leave , received an unfavorable comment on the conduct of his sister , took pen in hand and delivered himself thus : `` dear Sis . Alf sed he heard that you and Hardy was a runing together all the time and he though he wod gust quit having any thing mor to doo with you for he thought it was no more yuse . I think you made a dam good chouise to turn off as nise a feler as Alf Dyer and let that orney thefin , drunkard , damed card playing sun of a bich com to sea you , the god damed theaf and lop yeard pigen tode helion , he is too orney for hel . I will shute him as shore as I sea him '' . Initiation into combat sometimes elicited from soldier correspondents choice comments about their experiences and reactions . A Federal infantryman wrote to his father shortly after his first skirmish in Virginia : `` dear Pa . Went out a skouting yesterday . We got to one house where there were five secessionists . They brok & run and Arch holored out to shoot the ornery suns of biches and we all let go at them . Thay may say what they please but godamit Pa it is fun '' . Some of the choicest remarks made by soldiers in their letters were in disparagement of unpopular officers . A Mississippi soldier wrote : `` our General Reub Davis is a vain , stuck-up , illiterate ass '' . An Alabamian wrote : `` Col. Henry is ( an ignoramus ) fit for nothing higher than the cultivation of corn '' . A Floridian stated that his officers were `` not fit to tote guts to a bear '' . On December 9 , 1862 , Sergeant Edwin H. Fay , an unusual Louisianan who held A.B. and M.A. degrees from Harvard University and who before the war was headmaster of a private school for boys in Louisiana , wrote his wife : `` I saw Pemberton and he is the most insignificant puke I ever saw . His head cannot contain enough sense to command a regiment , much less a corps . Jackson runs first and his Cavalry are well drilled to follow their leader . He is not worth shucks . But he is a West Point graduate and therefore must be born to command '' . Similar comments about officers are to be found in the letters of Northern soldiers . A Massachusetts soldier , who seems to have been a Civil War version of Bill Mauldin , wrote : `` the officers consider themselves as made of a different material from the low fellows in the ranks . They get all the glory and most of the pay and don't earn ten cents apiece on the average , the drunken rascals '' . Private George Gray Hunter of Pennsylvania wrote : `` I am well convinced in my own mind that had it not been for officers this war would have ended long ago '' . Another Yankee became so disgusted as to state : `` I wish to God one half of our officers were knocked in the head by slinging them against ( the other half ) '' . No group of officers came in for more spirited denunciation than the doctors . One Federal soldier wrote : `` the docters is no aconte -- hell will be filde with do(c)ters and offersey when this war is over '' . Shortly after the beginning of Sherman's Georgia campaign , an ailing Yank wrote his homefolk : `` the surgeon insisted on sending me to the hospital for treatment . I insisted on takeing the field and prevailed -- thinking that I had better die by rebel bullets than ( by ) Union quackery '' . The attitudes which the Rebs and Yanks took toward each other were very much the same and ranged over the same gamut of feeling , from friendliness to extreme hatred . The Rebs were , to a Massachusetts corporal , `` fighting madmen or not men at all but whiskey & gunpowder put into a human frame '' . A Pennsylvania soldier wrote that `` they were the hardest looking set of men that ever I saw . They looked as if they had been fed on vinegar and shavings . '' Private Jenkins Lloyd Jones of the Wisconsin Light Artillery wrote in his diary : `` I strolled among the Alabamans on the right , found some of the greenest specimens of humanity I think in the universe , their ignorance being little less than the slave they despise with as imperfect a dialect . They recooned as how you'uns all would be a heap wus to we'uns all ' '' . In a similar vein , but writing from the opposite side , Thomas Taylor , a private in the 6th Alabama Volunteers , in a letter to his wife , stated : `` you know that my heart is with you but I never could have been satisfied to have staid at home when my country is invaded by a thievin foe , by a set of cowardly skunks whose motto is Booty . The popularity of folklore in America stands in direct proportion to the popularity of nationalism in America . And the emphasis on nationalism in America is in proportion to the growth of American influence across the world . Thus , if we are to observe American folklore in the twentieth century , we will do well to establish the relationships between folklore , nationalism and imperialism at the outset . Historians have come to recognize two cardinal facts concerning nationalism and international influence . 1 ) Every age rewrites the events of its history in terms of what should have been , creating legends about itself that rationalize contemporary beliefs and excuse contemporary actions . What actually occurred in the past is seldom as important as what a given generation feels must have occurred . 2 ) As a country superimposes its cultural and political attitudes on others , it searches its heritage in hopes of justifying its aggressiveness . Its folklore and legend , usually disguised as history , are allowed to account for group actions , to provide a focal point for group loyalty , and to become a cohesive force for national identification . One can apply these facts to Britain in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as she spread her dominion over palm and pine , and they can be applied again to the United States in more recent years . The popularity of local color literature before the Spanish-American War , the steady currency of the Lincoln myth , the increased emphasis on the frontier West in our mass media are cases in point . Nor is it an accident that baseball , growing into the national game in the last 75 years , has become a microcosm of American life , that learned societies such as the American Folklore Society and the American Historical Association were founded in the 1880s , or that courses in American literature , American civilization , American anything have swept our school and college curricula . Of course , nationalism has really outlived its usefulness in a country as world-oriented as ours , and its continued existence reflects one of the major culture lags of the twentieth-century United States . Yet nationalism has lost few of its charms for the historian , writer or man in the street . It is an understandable paradox that most American history and most American literature is today written from an essentially egocentric and isolationistic point of view at the very time America is spreading her dominion over palm and pine . After all , the average American as he lies and waits for the enemy in Korea or as she scans the newspaper in some vain hope of personal contact with the front is unconcerned that his or her plight is the result of a complex of personal , economic and governmental actions far beyond the normal citizen's comprehension and control . Anyone's identification with an international struggle , whether warlike or peaceful , requires absurd oversimplification and intense emotional involvement . Such identification comes for each group in each crisis by rewriting history into legend and developing appropriate national heroes . In America , such self-deception has served a particularly useful purpose . A heterogeneous people have needed it to attain an element of cultural and political cohesion in a new and ever-changing land . But we must never forget , most of the appropriate heroes and their legends were created overnight , to answer immediate needs , almost always with conscious aims and ends . Parson Weems's George Washington became the symbol of honesty and the father image of the uniting States . Abraham Lincoln emerged as an incarnation of the national Constitution . Robert E. Lee represented the dignity needed by a rebelling confederacy . And their roles are paralleled by those of Patrick Henry , Nathan Hale , Andrew Jackson , Davy Crockett , Theodore Roosevelt and many , many more . Therefore , the scholar , as he looks at our national folklore of the last 60 years , will be mindful of two facts . 1 ) Most of the legends that are created to fan the fires of patriotism are essentially propagandistic and are not folk legends at all . 2 ) The concept that an `` American national folklore '' exists is itself probably another propagandistic legend . Folklore is individually created art that a homogeneous group of people preserve , vary and recreate through oral transmission . It has come to mean myths , legends , tales , songs , proverbs , riddles , superstitions , rhymes and such literary forms of expression . Related to written literature , and often remaining temporarily frozen in written form , it loses its vitality when transcribed or removed from its oral existence . Though it may exist in either literate or illiterate societies , it assumes a role of true cultural importance only in the latter . In its propagandistic and commercial haste to discover our folk heritage , the public has remained ignorant of definitions such as this . Enthusiastically , Americans have swept subliterary and bogus materials like Paul Bunyan tales , Abe Lincoln anecdotes and labor union songs up as true products of our American oral tradition . Nor have we remembered that in the melting pot of America the hundreds of isolated and semi-isolated ethnic , regional and occupational groups did not fuse into a homogeneous national unit until long after education and industrialization had caused them to cast oral tradition aside as a means of carrying culturally significant material . Naturally , such scholarly facts are of little concern to the man trying to make money or fan patriotism by means of folklore . That much of what he calls folklore is the result of beliefs carefully sown among the people with the conscious aim of producing a desired mass emotional reaction to a particular situation or set of situations is irrelevant . As long as his material is Americana , can in some way be ascribed to the masses and appears `` democratic '' to his audience , he remains satisfied . From all this we can now see that two streams of development run through the history of twentieth-century American folklore . On the one side we have the university professors and their students , trained in Teutonic methods of research , who have sought out , collected and studied the true products of the oral traditions of the ethnic , regional and occupational groups that make up this nation . On the other we have the flag-wavers and the national sentimentalists who have been willing to use any patriotic , `` frontier western '' or colonial material willy-nilly . Unfortunately , few of the artists ( writers , movie producers , dramatists and musicians ) who have used American folklore since 1900 have known enough to distinguish between the two streams even in the most general of ways . After all , the field is large , difficult to define and seldom taught properly to American undergraduates . In addition , this country has been settled by many peoples of many heritages and their lore has become acculturated slowly , in an age of print and easy communication , within an ever-expanding and changing society . The problems confuse even the experts . For that matter , the experts themselves are a mixed breed . Anthropologists , housewives , historians and such by profession , they approach their discipline as amateurs , collectors , commercial propagandists , analysts or some combination of the four . They have widely varying backgrounds and aims . They have little `` esprit de corps '' . The outlook for the amateur , for instance , is usually dependent on his fondness for local history or for the picturesque . His love of folklore has romanticism in it , and he doesn't care much about the dollar-sign or the footnote . Folklore is his hobby , and he , all too rightly , wishes it to remain as such . The amateur is closely related to the collector , who is actually no more than the amateur who has taken to the field . The collector enjoys the contact with rural life ; ; he hunts folklore for the very `` field and stream '' reasons that many persons hunt game ; ; and only rarely is he acutely concerned with the meaning of what he has located . Fundamentally , both these types , the amateur and the collector , are uncritical and many of them don't distinguish well between real folklore and bogus material . But there are also the commercial propagandists and the analysts -- one dominated by money , the other by nineteenth-century German scholarship . Both are primarily concerned with the uses that can be made of the material that the collector has found . Both shudder at the thought of proceeding too far beyond the sewage system and the electric light lines . The commercial propagandist , who can't afford to be critical , gets along well with the amateur , from whom he feeds , but he frequently steps on the analyst's toes by refusing to keep his material genuine . His standards are , of course , completely foreign to those of the analyst . To both the amateur and the commercial progandist the analyst lacks a soul , lacks appreciation with his endless probings and classifications . Dominated by the vicious circle of the university promotion system , the analyst looks down on and gets along poorly with the other three groups , although he cannot deny his debt to the collector . The knowledge that most Americans have of folklore comes through contact with commercial propagandists and a few energetic amateurs and collectors . The work done by the analysts , the men who really know what folklore is all about , has no more appeal than any other work of a truly scientific sort and reaches a limited , learned audience . Publishers want books that will sell , recording studios want discs that will not seem strange to ears used to hillbilly and jazz music , grade and high schools want quaint , but moral , material . The analyst is apt to be too honest to fit in . As a result , most people don't have more than a vague idea what folklore actually is ; ; they see it as a potpourri of charming , moral legends and patriotic anecdotes , with a superstition or remedy thrown in here and there . And so well is such ignorance preserved by the amateur and the money-maker that even at the college level most of the hundred-odd folklore courses given in the United States survive on sentiment and nationalism alone . If one wishes to discuss a literary figure who uses folklore in his work , the first thing he must realize is that the literary figure is probably part of this ignorant American public . And while every writer must be dealt with as a special case , the interested student will want to ask himself a number of questions about each . Does the writer know the difference between an `` ersatz '' ballad or tall tale and a true product of the folk ? When the writer uses material does he tamper with it to improve its commercial effect or does he leave it pure ? Is the writer propagandistic ? Is he swept away by sentiment and nostalgia for an America that was ? Or does he sincerely want to tap the real springs of American attitude and culture regardless of how unpopular and embarrassing they may be ? When he gets the answers to his questions he will be discouraged . In the first place , a good many writers who are said to use folklore , do not , unless one counts an occasional superstition or tale . Robert Frost , for instance , writes about rural life in New England , but he does not include any significant amount of folklore in his poems . This has not , however , prevented publishers from labeling him a `` folk poet '' , simply because he is a rural one . In the second place , a large number of writers , making a more direct claim than Frost to being `` folk writers '' of one sort or another , clearly make no distinctions between genuine and bogus material . Stephen Vincent Benet's John Brown's Body comes immediately to mind in this connection , as does John Steinbeck's The Grapes Of Wrath and Carl Sandburg's The People , Yes . The last two writers introduce strong political bias into their works , and not unlike the union leaders that we will discuss soon , see folklore as a reservoir of protest by a downtrodden and publically silenced mass . Folklore , as used by such writers , really reflects images engraved into it by the very person using it . The folk are simply not homogeneous with respect to nation or political attitude . In fact , there is much evidence to indicate they don't care a bit about anything beyond their particular regional , ethnic and occupational limits . Nevertheless , with a reading public that longs for the `` good old days '' and with an awareness of our expanding international interests , it is easy for the Benets to obtain a magnified position in literature by use of all sorts of Americana , real or fake , and it is easy for the Steinbecks and Sandburgs to support their messages of reform by reading messages of reform into the minds of the folk . As part of the same arrangement , Torrio had , in the spirit of peace and good will , and in exchange for armed support in the April election campaign , bestowed upon O'Banion a third share in the Hawthorne Smoke Shop proceeds and a cut in the Cicero beer trade . The coalition was to prove inadvisable . O'Banion was a complex and frightening man , whose bright blue eyes stared with a kind of frozen candour into others' . He had a round , frank Irish face , creased in a jovial grin that stayed bleakly in place even when he was pumping bullets into someone's body . He carried three guns -- one in the right trouser pocket , one under his left armpit , one in the left outside coat pocket -- and was equally lethal with both hands . He killed accurately , freely , and dispassionately . The police credited him with twenty-five murders but he was never brought to trial for one of them . Like a fair number of bootleggers he disliked alcohol . He was an expert florist , tenderly dextrous in the arrangement of bouquets and wreaths . He had no apparent comprehension of morality ; ; he divided humanity into `` right guys '' and `` wrong guys '' , and the wrong ones he was always willing to kill and trample under . He had what was described by a psychologist as a `` sunny brutality '' . He walked with a heavy list to the right , as that leg was four inches shorter than the other , but the lurch did not reduce his feline quickness with his guns . Landesco thought him `` just a superior sort of plugugly '' but he was , in fact , with his aggression and hostility , and nerveless indifference to risking or administering pain , a casebook psychopath . He was also at this time , although not so interwoven in high politics and the rackets as Torrio and Capone , the most powerful and most dangerous mob leader in the Chicago underworld , the roughneck king . O'Banion was born in poverty , the son of an immigrant Irish plasterer , in the North Side's Little Hell , close by the Sicilian quarter and Death Corner . He had been a choir boy at the Holy Name Cathedral and also served as an acolyte to Father O'Brien . The influence of Mass was less pervasive than that of the congested , slum tenements among the bawdy houses , honkytonks , and sawdust saloons of his birthplace ; ; he ran wild with the child gangs of the neighbourhood , and went through the normal pressure-cooker course of thieving , police-dodging , and housebreaking . At the age of ten , when he was working as a newsboy in the Loop , he was knocked down by a streetcar which resulted in his permanently shortened leg . Because of this he was known as Gimpy ( but , as with Capone and his nickname of Scarface , never in his presence ) . In his teens O'Banion was enrolled in the vicious Market Street gang and he became a singing waiter in McGovern's Cafe , a notoriously low and rowdy dive in North Clark Street , where befuddled customers were methodically looted of their money by the singing waiters before being thrown out . He then got a job with the Chicago Herald-Examiner as a circulation slugger , a rough fighter employed to see that his paper's news pitches were not trespassed upon by rival vendors . He was also at the same time gaining practical experience as a safe breaker and highwayman , and learning how to shoot to kill from a Neanderthal convicted murderer named Gene Geary , later committed to Chester Asylum as a homicidal maniac , but whose eyes misted with tears when the young Dion sang a ballad about an Irish mother in his clear and syrupy tenor . O'Banion's first conflict with the police came in 1909 , at seventeen , when he was committed to Bridewell Prison for three months for burglary ; ; two years later he served another three months for assault . Those were his only interludes behind bars , although he collected four more charges on his police record in 1921 and 1922 , three for burglary and one for robbery . But by now O'Banion's political pull was beginning to be effective . On the occasion of his 1922 indictment the $10,000 bond was furnished by an alderman , and the charge was nolle prossed . On one of his 1921 ventures he was actually come upon by a Detective Sergeant John J. Ryan down on his knees with a tool embedded in a labour office safe in the Postal Telegraph Building ; ; the jury wanted better evidence than that and he was acquitted , at a cost of $30,000 in bribes , it was estimated . As promptly as Torrio , O'Banion jumped into bootlegging . He conducted it with less diplomacy and more spontaneous violence than the Sicilians , but he had his huge North Side portion to exploit and he made a great deal of money . Unlike the Sicilians , he additionally conducted holdups , robberies , and safe-cracking expeditions , and refused to touch prostitution . He was also personally active in ward politics , and by 1924 O'Banion had acquired sufficient political might to be able to state : `` I always deliver my borough as per requirements '' . But whose requirements ? Until 1924 O'Banion pistoleers and knuckle-duster bullyboys had kept his North Side domain solidly Democratic . There was a question-and-answer gag that went around at that time : Q. `` Who'll carry the Forty-second and Forty-third wards '' ? A. O'Banion , in his pistol pocket '' . But as November 1924 drew close the Democratic hierarchy was sorely troubled by grapevine reports that O'Banion was being wooed by the opposition , and was meeting and conferring with important Republicans . To forestall any change of allegiance , the Democrats hastily organised a testimonial banquet for O'Banion , as public reward for his past services and as a reminder of where his loyalties lay . The reception was held in a private dining room of the Webster Hotel on Lincoln Park West . It was an interesting fraternisation of ex-convicts , union racketeers , ward heelers , sold-out officials , and gunmen . The guest list is in itself a little parable of the state of American civic life at this time . It included the top O'Banion men and Chief of Detectives Michael Hughes . When Mayor Dever heard of the banquet he summoned Hughes for an explanation of why he had been dishonouring the police department by consorting with these felons and fixers . Hughes said that he had understood the party was to be in honour of Jerry O'Connor , the proprieter of a Loop gambling house . `` But when I arrived and recognised a number of notorious characters I had thrown into the detective bureau basement half a dozen times , I knew I had been framed , and withdrew almost at once '' . In fact , O'Connor was honoured during the ceremony with the presentation of a $2500 diamond stickpin . There was a brief interruption while one of O'Banion's men jerked out both his guns and threatened to shoot a waiter who was pestering him for a tip . Then O'Banion was presented with a platinum watch set with rubies and diamonds . This dinner was the start of a new blatancy in the relationship between the gangs and the politicians , which , prior to 1924 , says Pasley , `` had been maintained with more or less stealth '' , but which henceforth was marked by these ostentatious gatherings , denounced by a clergyman as `` Belshazzar feasts '' , at which `` politicians fraternized cheek by jowl with gangsters , openly , in the big downtown hotels '' . Pasley continued : `` They became an institution of the Chicago scene and marked the way to the moral and financial collapse of the municipal and county governments in 1928-29 '' . However , this inaugural feast did its sponsors no good whatever . O'Banion accepted his platinum watch and the tributes to his loyalty , and proceeded with the bigger and better Republican deal . On Election Day -- November 4 -- he energetically marshalled his force of bludgeon men , bribers , and experts in forging repeat votes . The result was a landslide for the Republican candidates . This further demonstration of O'Banion's ballooning power did not please Torrio and Capone . In the past year there had been too many examples of his euphoric self-confidence and self-aggrandisement for their liking . He behaved publicly with a cocky , swaggering truculence that offended their vulpine Latin minds , and behaved towards them personally with an unimpressed insolence that enraged them beneath their blandness . They were disturbed by his idiotic bravado -- as , when his bodyguard , Yankee Schwartz , complained that he had been snubbed by Dave Miller , a prize-fight referee , chieftain of a Jewish gang and one of four brothers of tough reputation , who were Hirschey , a gambler-politician in loose beer-running league with Torrio and O'Banion , Frank , a policeman , and Max , the youngest . To settle this slight , O'Banion went down to the La Salle Theatre in the Loop , where , he had learned , Dave Miller was attending the opening of a musical comedy . At the end of the performance , Dave and Max came out into the brilliantly lit foyer among a surge of gowned and tuxedoed first nighters . O'Banion drew his guns and fired at Dave , severely wounding him in the stomach . A second bullet ricocheted off Max's belt buckle , leaving him unhurt but in some distress . O'Banion tucked away his gun and walked out of the theatre ; ; he was neither prosecuted nor even arrested . That sort of braggadocio , for that sort of reason , in the view of Torrio and Capone , was a nonsense . A further example of the incompatible difference in personalities was when two policemen held up a Torrio beer convoy on a West Side street and demanded $300 to let it through . One of the beer-runners telephoned O'Banion -- on a line tapped by the detective bureau -- and reported the situation . O'Banion's reaction was : `` Three hundred dollars ! To them bums ? Why , I can get them knocked off for half that much '' . Upon which the detective bureau despatched rifle squads to prevent trouble if O'Banion should send his gunmen out to deal with the hijacking policemen . But in the meantime the beer-runner , unhappy with this solution , telephoned Torrio and returned to O'Banion with the message : `` Say , Dionie , I just been talking to Johnny , and he said to let them cops have the three hundred . He says he don't want no trouble '' . But Torrio and Capone had graver cause to hate and distrust the Irishman . For three years , since the liquor territorial conference , Torrio had , with his elastic patience , and because he knew that retaliation could cause only violent warfare and disaster to business , tolerated O'Banion's impudent double-crossing . They had suffered , in sulky silence , the sight of his sharp practice in Cicero . When , as a diplomatic gesture of amity and in payment for the loan of gunmen in the April election , Torrio had given O'Banion a slice of Cicero , the profits from that district had been $20,000 a month . In six months O'Banion had boosted the profits to $100,000 a month -- mainly by bringing pressure to bear on fifty Chicago speak-easy proprietors to shift out to the suburb . These booze customers had until then been buying their supplies from the Sheldon , Saltis-McErlane , and Druggan-Lake gangs , and now they were competing for trade with the Torrio-Capone saloons ; ; once again O'Banion's brash recklessness had caused a proliferation of ill will . The revenue from O'Banion's Cicero territory went up still higher , until the yield was more than the Torrio-Capone takings from the far bigger trade area of Chicago's South and West Sides . But he still showed no intention of sharing with the syndicate . At last , even the controlled Torrio was unable to hold still , and he tentatively suggested that O'Banion should take a percentage in the Stickney brothels in return for one from his Cicero beer concession . O'Banion's reply was a raucous laugh and a flat refusal . Still more jealous bitterness was engendered by the O'Banion gang's seizure from a West Side marshalling yard of a freight-car load of Canadian whisky worth $100,000 and by one of the biggest coups of the Prohibition era -- the Sibley warehouse robbery , which became famous for the cool brazenness of the operation . Here was stored $1,000,000 worth of bonded whisky . These 1750 cases were carted off in a one-night operation by the O'Banion men , who left in their stead the same number of barrels filled with water . A tsunami may be started by a sea bottom slide , an earthquake or a volcanic eruption . The most infamous of all was launched by the explosion of the island of Krakatoa in 1883 ; ; it raced across the Pacific at 300 miles an hour , devastated the coasts of Java and Sumatra with waves 100 to 130 feet high , and pounded the shore as far away as San Francisco . The ancient Greeks recorded several catastrophic inundations by huge waves . Whether or not Plato's tale of the lost continent of Atlantis is true , skeptics concede that the myth may have some foundation in a great tsunami of ancient times . Indeed , a tremendously destructive tsunami that arose in the Arabian Sea in 1945 has even revived the interest of geologists and archaeologists in the Biblical story of the Flood . One of the most damaging tsunami on record followed the famous Lisbon earthquake of November 1 , 1755 ; ; its waves persisted for a week and were felt as far away as the English coast . Tsunami are rare , however , in the Atlantic Ocean ; ; they are far more common in the Pacific . Japan has had 15 destructive ones ( eight of them disastrous ) since 1596 . The Hawaiian Islands are struck severely an average of once every 25 years . In 1707 an earthquake in Japan generated waves so huge that they piled into the Inland Sea ; ; one wave swamped more than 1,000 ships and boats in Osaka Bay . A tsunami in the Hawaiian Islands in 1869 washed away an entire town ( Ponoluu ) , leaving only two forlorn trees standing where the community had been . In 1896 a Japanese tsunami killed 27,000 people and swept away 10,000 homes . The dimensions of these waves dwarf all our usual standards of measurement . An ordinary sea wave is rarely more than a few hundred feet long from crest to crest -- no longer than 320 feet in the Atlantic or 1,000 feet in the Pacific . But a tsunami often extends more than 100 miles and sometimes as much as 600 miles from crest to crest . While a wind wave never travels at more than 60 miles per hour , the velocity of a tsunami in the open sea must be reckoned in hundreds of miles per hour . The greater the depth of the water , the greater is the speed of the wave ; ; Lagrange's law says that its velocity is equal to the square root of the product of the depth times the acceleration due to gravity . In the deep waters of the Pacific these waves reach a speed of 500 miles per hour . Tsunami are so shallow in comparison with their length that in the open ocean they are hardly detectable . Their amplitude sometimes is as little as two feet from trough to crest . Usually it is only when they approach shallow water on the shore that they build up to their terrifying heights . On the fateful day in 1896 when the great waves approached Japan , fishermen at sea noticed no unusual swells . Not until they sailed home at the end of the day , through a sea strewn with bodies and the wreckage of houses , were they aware of what had happened . The seemingly quiet ocean had crashed a wall of water from 10 to 100 feet high upon beaches crowded with bathers , drowning thousands of them and flattening villages along the shore . The giant waves are more dangerous on flat shores than on steep ones . They usually range from 20 to 60 feet in height , but when they pour into a V-shaped inlet or harbor they may rise to mountainous proportions . Generally the first salvo of a tsunami is a rather sharp swell , not different enough from an ordinary wave to alarm casual observers . This is followed by a tremendous suck of water away from the shore as the first great trough arrives . Reefs are left high and dry , and the beaches are covered with stranded fish . At Hilo large numbers of people ran out to inspect the amazing spectacle of the denuded beach . Many of them paid for their curiosity with their lives , for some minutes later the first giant wave roared over the shore . After an earthquake in Japan in 1793 people on the coast at Tugaru were so terrified by the extraordinary ebbing of the sea that they scurried to higher ground . When a second quake came , they dashed back to the beach , fearing that they might be buried under landslides . Just as they reached the shore , the first huge wave crashed upon them . A tsunami is not a single wave but a series . The waves are separated by intervals of 15 minutes to an hour or more ( because of their great length ) , and this has often lulled people into thinking after the first great wave has crashed that it is all over . The waves may keep coming for many hours . Usually the third to the eighth waves in the series are the biggest . Among the observers of the 1946 tsunami at Hilo was Francis P. Shepard of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography , one of the world's foremost marine geologists . He was able to make a detailed inspection of the waves . Their onrush and retreat , he reported , was accompanied by a great hissing , roaring and rattling . The third and fourth waves seemed to be the highest . On some of the islands' beaches the waves came in gently ; ; they were steepest on the shores facing the direction of the seaquake from which the waves had come . In Hilo Bay they were from 21 to 26 feet high . The highest waves , 55 feet , occurred at Pololu Valley . Scientists and fishermen have occasionally seen strange by-products of the phenomenon . During a 1933 tsunami in Japan the sea glowed brilliantly at night . The luminosity of the water is now believed to have been caused by the stimulation of vast numbers of the luminescent organism Noctiluca miliaris by the turbulence of the sea . Japanese fishermen have sometimes observed that sardines hauled up in their nets during a tsunami have enormously swollen stomachs ; ; the fish have swallowed vast numbers of bottom-living diatoms , raised to the surface by the disturbance . The waves of a 1923 tsunami in Sagami Bay brought to the surface and battered to death huge numbers of fishes that normally live at a depth of 3,000 feet . Gratified fishermen hauled them in by the thousands . The tsunami-warning system developed since the 1946 disaster in Hawaii relies mainly on a simple and ingenious instrument devised by Commander C. K. Green of the Coast and Geodetic Survey staff . It consists of a series of pipes and a pressure-measuring chamber which record the rise and fall of the water surface . Ordinary water tides are disregarded . But when waves with a period of between 10 and 40 minutes begin to roll over the ocean , they set in motion a corresponding oscillation in a column of mercury which closes an electric circuit . This in turn sets off an alarm , notifying the observers at the station that a tsunami is in progress . Such equipment has been installed at Hilo , Midway , Attu and Dutch Harbor . The moment the alarm goes off , information is immediately forwarded to Honolulu , which is the center of the warning system . This center also receives prompt reports on earthquakes from four Coast Survey stations in the Pacific which are equipped with seismographs . Its staff makes a preliminary determination of the epicenter of the quake and alerts tide stations near the epicenter for a tsunami . By means of charts showing wave-travel times and depths in the ocean at various locations , it is possible to estimate the rate of approach and probable time of arrival at Hawaii of a tsunami getting under way at any spot in the Pacific . The civil and military authorities are then advised of the danger , and they issue warnings and take all necessary protective steps . All of these activities are geared to a top-priority communication system , and practice tests have been held to assure that everything will work smoothly . Since the 1946 disaster there have been 15 tsunami in the Pacific , but only one was of any consequence . On November 4 , 1952 , an earthquake occurred under the sea off the Kamchatka Peninsula . At 17:07 that afternoon ( Greenwich time ) the shock was recorded by the seismograph alarm in Honolulu . The warning system immediately went into action . Within about an hour with the help of reports from seismic stations in Alaska , Arizona and California , the quake's epicenter was placed at 51 degrees North latitude and 158 degrees East longitude . While accounts of the progress of the tsunami came in from various points in the Pacific ( Midway reported it was covered with nine feet of water ) , the Hawaiian station made its calculations and notified the military services and the police that the first big wave would arrive at Honolulu at 23:30 Greenwich time . It turned out that the waves were not so high as in 1946 . They hurled a cement barge against a freighter in Honolulu Harbor , knocked down telephone lines , marooned automobiles , flooded lawns , killed six cows . But not a single human life was lost , and property damage in the Hawaiian Islands did not exceed $800,000 . There is little doubt that the warning system saved lives and reduced the damage . But it is plain that a warning system , however efficient , is not enough . In the vulnerable areas of the Pacific there should be restrictions against building homes on exposed coasts , or at least a requirement that they be either raised off the ground or anchored strongly against waves . The key to the world of geology is change ; ; nothing remains the same . Life has evolved from simple combinations of molecules in the sea to complex combinations in man . The land , too , is changing , and earthquakes are daily reminders of this . Earthquakes result when movements in the earth twist rocks until they break . Sometimes this is accompanied by visible shifts of the ground surface ; ; often the shifts cannot be seen , but they are there ; ; and everywhere can be found scars of earlier breaks once deeply buried . Today's earthquakes are most numerous in belts where the earth's restlessness is presently concentrated , but scars of the past show that there is no part of the earth that has not had them . The effects of earthquakes on civilization have been widely publicized , even overemphasized . The role of an earthquake in starting the destruction of whole cities is tremendously frightening , but fire may actually be the principal agent in a particular disaster . Superstition has often blended with fact to color reports . We have learned from earthquakes much of what we now know about the earth's interior , for they send waves through the earth which emerge with information about the materials through which they have traveled . These waves have shown that 1,800 miles below the surface a liquid core begins , and that it , in turn , has a solid inner core . Earthquakes originate as far as 400 miles below the surface , but they do not occur at greater depths . Two unsolved mysteries are based on these facts . ( 1 ) As far down as 400 miles below the surface the material should be hot enough to be plastic and adjust itself to twisting forces by sluggish flow rather than by breaking , as rigid surface rocks do . ( 2 ) If earthquakes do occur at such depths , why not deeper ? Knowledge gained from studying earthquake waves has been applied in various fields . In the search for oil and gas , we make similar waves under controlled conditions with dynamite and learn from them where there are buried rock structures favorable to the accumulation of these resources . We have also developed techniques for recognizing and locating underground nuclear tests through the waves in the ground which they generate . The following discussion of this subject has been adapted from the book Causes Of Catastrophe by L. Don Leet . The restless earth and its interior At twelve minutes after five on the morning of Wednesday , April 18 , 1906 , San Francisco was shaken by a severe earthquake . A sharp tremor was followed by a jerky roll . In Ireland's County Limerick , near the River Shannon , there is a quiet little suburb by the name of Garryowen , which means `` Garden of Owen '' . Undoubtedly none of the residents realize the influence their town has had on American military history , or the deeds of valor that have been done in its name . The cry `` Garryowen '' ! Bursting from the lips of a charging cavalry trooper was the last sound heard on this earth by untold numbers of Cheyennes , Sioux and Apaches , Mexican banditos under Pancho Villa , Japanese in the South Pacific , and Chinese and North Korean Communists in Korea . Garryowen is the battle cry of the 7th U.S. Cavalry Regiment , `` The Fighting Seventh '' . Today a battle cry may seem an anachronism , for in the modern Army , esprit de corps has been sacrificed to organizational charts and tables . But don't tell that to a veteran of the Fighting Seventh , especially in a saloon on Saturday night . Of all the thousands of men who have served in the 7th Cav , perhaps no one knows its spirit better than Lieutenant Colonel Melbourne C. Chandler . Wiry and burr-headed , with steel blue eyes and a chest splattered with medals , Chandler is the epitome of the old-time trooper . The truth is , however , that when Mel Chandler first reported to the regiment the only steed he had ever ridden was a swivel chair and the only weapon he had ever wielded was a pencil . Chandler had been commissioned in the Medical Service Corps and was serving as a personnel officer for the Kansas City Medical Depot when he decided that if he was going to make the Army his career , he wanted to be in the fighting part of it . Though he knew no more about military science and tactics than any other desk officer , he managed to get transferred to the combat forces . The next thing he knew he was reporting for duty as commanding officer of Troop H , 7th Cavalry , in the middle of corps maneuvers in Japan . Outside of combat , he couldn't have landed in a tougher spot . First of all , no unit likes to have a new CO brought in from the outside , especially when he's an armchair trooper . Second , if there is ever a perfect time to pull the rug out from under him , it's on maneuvers . In combat , helping your CO make a fool of himself might mean getting yourself killed . But in maneuvers , with the top brass watching him all the time , it's easy . Chandler understood this and expected the worst . But his first few days with Troop H were full of surprises , beginning with First Sergeant Robert Early . Chandler had expected a tough old trooper with a gravel voice . Instead Sergeant Early was quiet , sharp and confident . He had enlisted in the Army straight out of high school and had immediately set about learning his new trade . There was no weapon Early could not take apart and reassemble blind-folded . He could lead a patrol and he knew his paper work . Further , he had taken full advantage of the Army's correspondence courses . He not only knew soldiering , but mathematics , history and literature as well . But for all his erudite confidence , Sergeant Early was right out of the Garryowen mold . He was filled with the spirit of the Fighting Seventh . That saved Mel Chandler . Sergeant Early let the new CO know just how lucky he was to be in the best troop in the best regiment in the United States Army . He fed the captain bits of history about the troops and the regiment . For example , it was a battalion of the 7th Cavalry under Colonel George Armstrong Custer that had been wiped out at the Battle of The Little Big Horn . It didn't take Captain Chandler long to realize that he had to carry a heavy load of tradition on his shoulders as commander of Troop Aj . But what made the load lighter was the realization that every officer , non-com and trooper was ready and willing to help him carry it , for the good of the troop and the regiment . Maneuvers over , the 7th returned to garrison duty in Tokyo , Captain Chandler still with them . It was the 7th Cavalry whose troopers were charged with guarding the Imperial Palace of the Emperor . But still Mel Chandler was not completely convinced that men would really die for a four-syllable word , `` Garryowen '' . The final proof was a small incident . It happened at the St. Patrick's Day party , a big affair for a regiment which had gone into battle for over three-quarters of a century to the strains of an Irish march . In the middle of the party Chandler looked up to see four smiling faces bearing down upon him , each beaming above the biggest , greenest shamrock he had ever seen . The faces belonged to Lieutenant Marvin Goulding , his wife and their two children . And when the singing began , it was the Gouldings who sang the old Irish songs the best . Though there was an occasional good-natured chuckle about Marvin Goulding , the Jewish officer from Chicago , singing tearfully about the ould sod , no one really thought it was strange . For Marvin Goulding , like Giovanni Martini , the bugler boy who carried Custer's last message , or Margarito Lopez , the one-man Army on Leyte , was a Garryowen , through and through . It was no coincidence that Goulding was one of the most beloved platoon leaders in the regiment . And so Mel Chandler got the spirit of Garryowen . He set out to keep Troop H the best troop in the best regiment . One of his innovations was to see to it that every man -- cook and clerk as well as rifleman -- qualified with every weapon in the troop . Even the mess sergeant , Bill Brown , a dapper , cocky transfer from an airborne division , went out on the range . The troop received a new leader , Lieutenant Robert M. Carroll , fresh out of ROTC and bucking for Regular Army status . Carroll was sharp and military , but he was up against tough competition for that RA berth , and he wanted to play it cool . So Mel Chandler set out to sell him on the spirit of Garryowen , just as he himself had been sold a short time before . When the Korean war began , on June 25 , 1950 , the anniversary of the day Custer had gone down fighting at the Little Big Horn and the day the regiment had assaulted the beachhead of Leyte during World War 2 , , the 7th Cavalry was not in the best fighting condition . Its entire complement of non-commissioned officers on the platoon level had departed as cadre for another unit , and its vehicles were still those used in the drive across Luzon in World War 2 . Just a month after the Korean War broke out , the 7th Cavalry was moving into the lines , ready for combat . From then on the Fighting Seventh was in the thick of the bitterest fighting in Korea . One night on the Naktong River , Mel Chandler called on that fabled esprit de corps . The regiment was dug in on the east side of the river and the North Koreans were steadily building up a concentration of crack troops on the other side . The troopers knew an attack was coming , but they didn't know when , and they didn't know where . At 6 o'clock on the morning of August 12 , they were in doubt no longer . Then it came , against Troop Aj . The enemy had filtered across the river during the night and a full force of 1000 men , armed with Russian machine guns , attacked the position held by Chandler's men . They came in waves . First came the cannon fodder , white-clad civilians being driven into death as a massive human battering ram . They were followed by crack North Korean troops , who mounted one charge after another . They overran the 7th Cav's forward machine-gun positions through sheer weight of numbers , over piles of their own dead . Another force flanked the company and took up a position on a hill to the rear . Captain Chandler saw that it was building up strength . He assembled a group of 25 men , composed of wounded troopers awaiting evacuation , the company clerk , supply men , cooks and drivers , and led them to the hill . One of the more seriously wounded was Lieutenant Carroll , the young officer bucking for the Regular Army . Chandler left Carroll at the bottom of the hill to direct any reinforcements he could find to the fight . Then Mel Chandler started up the hill . He took one step , two , broke into a trot and then into a run . The first thing he knew the words `` Garryowen '' ! Burst from his throat . His followers shouted the old battle cry after him and charged the hill , firing as they ran . The Koreans fell back , but regrouped at the top of the hill and pinned down the cavalrymen with a screen of fire . Chandler , looking to right and left to see how his men were faring , suddenly saw another figure bounding up the hill , hurling grenades and hollering the battle cry as he ran . It was Bob Carroll , who had suddenly found himself imbued with the spirit of Garryowen . He had formed his own task force of three stragglers and led them up the hill in a Fighting Seventh charge . Because of this diversionary attack the main group that had been pinned down on the hill was able to surge forward again . But an enemy grenade hit Carroll in the head and detonated simultaneously . He went down like a wet rag and the attackers hit the dirt in the face of the withering enemy fire . Enemy reinforcements came pouring down , seeking a soft spot . They found it at the junction between Troops H and G , and prepared to counterattack . Marvin Goulding saw what was happening . He turned to his platoon . `` Okay , men '' , he said . `` Follow me '' . Goulding leaped to his feet and started forward , `` Garryowen '' ! On his lips , his men following . But the bullets whacked home before he finished his battle cry and Marvin Goulding fell dead . For an instant his men hesitated , unable to believe that their lieutenant , the most popular officer in the regiment , was dead . Then they let out a bellow of anguish and rage and , cursing , screaming and hollering `` Garryowen '' ! They charged into the enemy like wild men . That finished the job that Captain Chandler and Lieutenant Carroll had begun . Goulding's platoon pushed back the enemy soldiers and broke up the timing of the entire enemy attack . Reinforcements came up quickly to take advantage of the opening made by Goulding's platoon . The North Koreans threw away their guns and fled across the rice paddies . Artillery and air strikes were called in to kill them by the hundreds . Though Bob Carroll seemed to have had his head practically blown off by the exploding grenade , he lived . Today he is a major -- in the Regular Army . So filled was Mel Chandler with the spirit of Garryowen that after Korea was over , he took on the job of writing the complete history of the regiment . After years of digging , nights and weekends , he put together the big , profusely illustrated book , Of Garryowen And Glory , which is probably the most complete history of any military unit . The battle of the Naktong River is just one example of how the battle cry and the spirit of The Fighting Seventh have paid off . For nearly a century the cry has never failed to rally the fighting men of the regiment . Take the case of Major Marcus A. Reno , who survived the Battle of The Little Big Horn in 1876 . From the enlisted men he pistol-whipped to the subordinate officer whose wife he tried to rape , a lot of men had plenty of reason heartily to dislike Marcus Reno . Many of his fellow officers refused to speak to him . But when a board of inquiry was called to look into the charges of cowardice made against him , the men who had seen Reno leave the battlefield and the officer who had heard Reno suggest that the wounded be left to be tortured by the Sioux , refused to say a harsh word against him . He was a member of The Fighting Seventh . Although it was at the Battle of The Little Horn , about which more words have been written than any other battle in American history , that the 7th Cavalry first made its mark in history , the regiment was ten years old by then . Brevet Major General George Armstrong Custer was the regiment's first permanent commander and , like such generals as George S. Patton and Terry De La Mesa Allen in their rise to military prominence , Custer was a believer in blood and guts warfare . During the Civil War , Custer , who achieved a brilliant record , was made brigadier general at the age of 23 . He finished the war as a major general , commanding a full division , and at 25 was the youngest major general in the history of the U.S. Army . I do not mean to suggest that these assumptions are self-evident , in the sense that everyone agrees with them . If they were , Walter Lippmann would be writing the same columns as George Sokolsky , and Herb Lock would have nothing to draw cartoons about . I do mean , however , that I take them for granted , and that everything I shall be saying would appear quite idiotic against any contrary assumptions . Assumption 1 . The ultimate objective of American policy is to help establish a world in which there is the largest possible measure of freedom and justice and peace and material prosperity ; ; and in particular -- since this is our special responsibility -- that these conditions be enjoyed by the people of the United States . I speak of `` the largest possible measure '' because any person who supposes that these conditions can be universally and perfectly achieved -- ever -- reckons without the inherent imperfectability of himself and his fellow human beings , and is therefore a dangerous man to have around . Assumption 2 . These conditions are unobtainable -- are not even approachable in the qualified sense I have indicated -- without the prior defeat of world Communism . This is true for two reasons : because Communism is both doctrinally , and in practice , antithetical to these conditions ; ; and because Communists have the will and , as long as Soviet power remains intact , the capacity to prevent their realization . Moreover , as Communist power increases , the enjoyment of these conditions throughout the world diminishes pro rata and the possibility of their restoration becomes increasingly remote . Assumption 3 . It follows that victory over Communism is the dominant , proximate goal of American policy . Proximate in the sense that there are more distant , more `` positive '' ends we seek , to which victory over Communism is but a means . But dominant in the sense that every other objective , no matter how worthy intrinsically , must defer to it . Peace is a worthy objective ; ; but if we must choose between peace and keeping the Communists out of Berlin , then we must fight . Freedom , in the sense of self-determination , is a worthy objective ; ; but if granting self-determination to the Algerian rebels entails sweeping that area into the Sino-Soviet orbit , then Algerian freedom must be postponed . Justice is a worthy objective ; ; but if justice for Bantus entails driving the government of the Union of South Africa away from the West , then the Bantus must be prepared to carry their identification cards yet a while longer . Prosperity is a worthy objective ; ; but if providing higher standards of living gets in the way of producing sufficient guns to resist Communist aggression , then material sacrifices and denials will have to be made . It may be , of course , that such objectives can be pursued consisently with a policy designed to overthrow Communism ; ; my point is that where conflicts arise they must always be resolved in favor of achieving the indispensable condition for a tolerant world -- the absence of Soviet Communist power . The uses of power This much having been said , the question remains whether we have the resources for the job we have to do -- defeat Communism -- and , if so , how those resources ought to be used . This brings us squarely to the problem of power , and the uses a nation makes of power . I submit that this is the key problem of international relations , that it always has been , that it always will be . And I suggest further that the main cause of the trouble we are in has been the failure of American policy-makers , ever since we assumed free world leadership in 1945 , to deal with this problem realistically and seriously . In the recent political campaign two charges were leveled affecting the question of power , and I think we might begin by trying to put them into proper focus . One was demonstrably false ; ; the other , for the most part , true . The first was that America had become -- or was in danger of becoming -- a second-rate military power . I know I do not have to dwell here on the absurdity of that contention . You may have misgivings about certain aspects of our military establishment -- I certainly do -- but you know any comparison of over-all American strength with over-all Soviet strength finds the United States not only superior , but so superior both in present weapons and in the development of new ones that our advantage promises to be a permanent feature of U.S.-Soviet relations for the foreseeable future . I have often searched for a graphic way of impressing our superiority on those Americans who have doubts , and I think Mr. Jameson Campaigne has done it well in his new book American Might And Soviet Myth . Suppose , he says , that the tables were turned , and we were in the Soviets' position : `` There would be more than 2,000 modern Soviet fighters , all better than ours , stationed at 250 bases in Mexico and the Caribbean . Overwhelming Russian naval power would always be within a few hundred miles of our coast . Half of the population of the U.S. would be needed to work on arms just to feed the people '' . Add this to the unrest in the countries around us where oppressed peoples would be ready to turn on us at the first opportunity . Add also a comparatively primitive industrial plant which would severely limit our capacity to keep abreast of the Soviets even in the missile field which is reputed to be our main strength . If we look at the situation this way , we can get an idea of Khrushchev's nightmarish worries -- or , at least , of the worries he might have if his enemies were disposed to exploit their advantage . U.S. `` prestige '' The other charge was that America's political position in the world has progressively deteriorated in recent years . The contention needs to be formulated with much greater precision than it ever was during the campaign , but once that has been done , I fail to see how any serious student of world affairs can quarrel with it . The argument was typically advanced in terms of U.S. `` prestige '' . Prestige , however , is only a minor part of the problem ; ; and even then , it is a concept that can be highly misleading . Prestige is a measure of how other people think of you , well or ill . But contrary to what was implied during the campaign , prestige is surely not important for its own sake . Only the vain and incurably sentimental among us will lose sleep simply because foreign peoples are not as impressed by our strength as they ought to be . The thing to lose sleep over is what people , having concluded that we are weaker than we are , are likely to do about it . The evidence suggests that foreign peoples believe the United States is weaker than the Soviet Union , and is bound to fall still further behind in the years ahead . This ignorant estimate , I repeat , is not of any interest in itself ; ; but it becomes very important if foreign peoples react the way human beings typically do -- namely , by taking steps to end up on what appears to be the winning side . To the extent , then , that declining U.S. prestige means that other nations will be tempted to place their bets on an ultimate American defeat , and will thus be more vulnerable to Soviet intimidation , there is reason for concern . Still , these guesses about the outcome of the struggle cannot be as important as the actual power relationship between the Soviet Union and ourselves . Here I do not speak of military power where our advantage is obvious and overwhelming but of political power -- of influence , if you will -- about which the relevant questions are : Is Soviet influence throughout the world greater or less than it was ten years ago ? And is Western influence greater or less than it used to be ? Communist gains In answering these questions , we need to ask not merely whether Communist troops have crossed over into territories they did not occupy before , and not merely whether disciplined agents of the Cominform are in control of governments from which they were formerly excluded : the success of Communism's war against the West does not depend on such spectacular and definitive conquests . Success may mean merely the displacement of Western influence . Communist political warfare , we must remember , is waged insidiously and in deliberate stages . Fearful of inviting a military showdown with the West which they could not win , the Communists seek to undermine Western power where the nuclear might of the West is irrelevant -- in backwoods guerrilla skirmishes , in mob uprisings in the streets , in parliaments , in clandestine meetings of undercover conspirators , at the United Nations , on the propaganda front , at diplomatic conferences -- preferably at the highest level . The Soviets understand , moreover , that the first step in turning a country toward Communism is to turn it against the West . Thus , typically , the first stage of a Communist takeover is to `` neutralize '' a country . The second stage is to retain the nominal classification of `` neutralist '' , while in fact turning the country into an active advocate and adherent of Soviet policy . And this may be as far as the process will go . The Kremlin's goal is the isolation and capture , not of Ghana , but of the United States -- and this purpose may be served very well by countries that masquerade under a `` neutralist '' mask , yet in fact are dependable auxiliaries of the Soviet Foreign Office . To recite the particulars of recent Soviet successes is hardly reassuring . Six years ago French Indochina , though in troubie , was in the Western camp . Today Northern Vietnam is overtly Communist ; ; Laos is teetering between Communism and pro-Communist neutralism ; ; Cambodia is , for all practical purposes , neutralist . Indonesia , in the early days of the Republic , leaned toward the West . Today Sukarno's government is heavily besieged by avowed Communists , and for all of its `` neutralist '' pretensions , it is a firm ally of Soviet policy . Ceylon has moved from a pro-Western orientation to a neutralism openly hostile to the West . In the Middle East , Iraq , Syria and Egypt were , a short while ago , in the Western camp . Today the Nasser and Kassem governments are adamantly hostile to the West , are dependent for their military power on Soviet equipment and personnel ; ; in almost every particular follow the Kremlin's foreign policy line . A short time ago all Africa was a Western preserve . Never mind whether the Kikiyus and the Bantus enjoyed Wilsonian self-determination : the point is that in the struggle for the world that vast land mass was under the domination and influence of the West . Today , Africa is swerving violently away from the West and plunging , it would seem , into the Soviet orbit . Latin America was once an area as `` safe '' for the West as Nebraska was for Nixon . Today it is up for grabs . One Latin American country , Cuba , has become a Soviet bridgehead ninety miles off our coast . In some countries the trend has gone further than others : Mexico , Panama , and Venezuela are displaying open sympathy for Castroism , and there is no country -- save the Dominican Republic whose funeral services we recently arranged -- where Castroism and Anti-Americanism does not prevent the government from unqualifiedly espousing the American cause . Only in Europe have our lines remained firm -- and there only on the surface . The strains of neutralism are running strong , notably in England , and even in Germany . Opportunities missed What have we to show by way of counter-successes ? We have had opportunities -- clear invitations to plant our influence on the other side of the Iron Curtain . There was the Hungarian Revolution which we praised and mourned , but did nothing about . There was the Polish Revolution which we misunderstood and then helped guide along a course favorable to Soviet interests . There was the revolution in Tibet which we pretended did not exist . Only in one instance have we moved purposively and effectively to dislodge existing Communist power : in Guatemala . And contrary to what has been said recently , we did not wait for `` outside pressures '' and `` world opinion '' to bring down that Communist government ; ; we moved decisively to effect an Anti-Communist coup d'etat . We served our national interests , and by so doing we saved the Guatemalan people the ultimate in human misery . The first rattle of the machine guns , at 7:10 in the evening , roused around me the varied voices and faces of fear . `` Sounds exactly like last time '' . The young man spoke steadily enough , but all at once he looked grotesquely unshaven . The middle-aged man said over and over , `` Why did I come here , why did I come here '' . Then he was sick . Amid the crackle of small arms and automatic weapons , I heard the thumping of mortars . Then the lights went out . This was my second day in Vientiane , the administrative capital of Laos , and my thoughts were none too brave . Where was my flashlight ? Where should I go ? To my room ? Better stay in the hotel lobby , where the walls looked good and thick . Chinese and Indian merchants across the street were slamming their steel shutters . Hotel attendants pulled parked bicycles into the lobby . A woman with a small boy slipped in between them . `` Please '' , she said , `` please '' . She held out her hand to show that she had money . The American newspaperman worried about getting to the cable office . But what was the story ? Had the Communist-led Pathet Lao finally come this far ? Or was it another revolt inside Vientiane ? `` Let's play hero '' , I said . `` Let's go to the roof and see '' . Gunfire saves the moon By 7:50 the answer was plain . There had been an eclipse of the moon . A traditional Lao explanation is that the moon was being swallowed by a toad , and the remedy was to make all possible noise , ideally with firearms . The din was successful , too , for just before the moon disappeared , the frightened toad had begun to spit it out again , which meant good luck all around . How quaint it all seemed the next day . A restaurant posted a reminder to patrons `` who became excited and left without paying their checks '' . But everyone I met had sought cover first and asked questions later . And no wonder , for Vientiane , the old City of Sandalwood , had become the City of Bullet Holes . I saw holes in planes at the airport and in cars in the streets . Along the main thoroughfares hardly a house had not been peppered . In place of the police headquarters was a new square filled with rubble . Mortars had demolished the defense ministry and set fire to the American Embassy next door . What had been the ambassador's suite was now jagged walls of blackened brick . This damage had been done in the battle of Vientiane , fought less than three months earlier when four successive governments had ruled here in three days ( December 9-11 , 1960 ) . And now , in March , all Laos suffered a state of siege . The Pathet Lao forces held two northern provinces and openly took the offensive in three more . Throughout the land their hit-and-run terrorists spread fear of ambush and death . `` And it's all the more tragic because it's so little deserved '' , said Mr. J. J. A. Frans , a Belgian official of the United Nations Educational , Scientific , and Cultural Organization . We talked after I hailed his Jeep marked with the U.N. flag . Practically all the people of Laos , he explained -- about two million of them -- are rice farmers , and the means and motives of modern war are as strange to them as clocks and steel plows . They look after their fields and children and water buffaloes in ten or eleven thousand villages , with an average of 200 souls . Nobody can tell more closely how many villages there are . They spread over an area no larger than Oregon ; ; yet they include peoples as different from one another as Oregonians are from Patagonians . Life must be kept in harmony `` . What matters here is family loyalty ; ; faith in the Buddha and staying at peace with the phis , the spirits ; ; and to live in harmony with nature '' . Harmony in Laos ? `` Precisely '' , said Mr. Frans . He spoke of the season of dryness and dust , brought by the monsoon from the northeast , in harmony with the season of rain and mud , brought by the monsoon from the southwest . The slim pirogues in harmony with the majestically meandering Mekong River . Shy , slender-waisted girls at the loom in harmony with the frangipani by the wayside . Even life in harmony with death . For so long as death was not violent , it was natural and to be welcomed , making a funeral a feast . To many a Frenchman -- they came 95 years ago , colonized , and stayed until Laos became independent in 1953 -- the land had been even more delightfully tranquil than Tahiti . Yet Laos was now one of the most explosive headaches of statesmen around the globe . The Pathet Lao , stiffened by Communist Veterans from neighboring North Viet Nam , were supplied by Soviet aircraft . The Royal Lao Army , on the other hand , was paid and equipped with American funds . In six years , U.S. aid had amounted to more than $1.60 for each American -- a total of three hundred million dollars . We were there at a moment when the situation in Laos threatened to ignite another war among the world's giants . Even if it did not , how would this little world of gentle people cope with its new reality of grenades and submachine guns ? To find out , we traveled throughout that part of Laos still nominally controlled , in the daytime at least , by the Royal Lao Army : from Attopeu , the City of Buffalo Dung in the southeast , to Muong Sing , the City of Lions in the northwest , close to Communist China ( map , page 250 ) . We rode over roads so rough that our Jeep came to rest atop the soil between ruts , all four wheels spinning uselessly . We flew in rickety planes so overloaded that we wondered why they didn't crash . In the end we ran into Communist artillery fire . `` We '' were Bill Garrett of the National Geographic Illustrations Staff , whose three cameras and eight lenses made him look as formidable as any fighting man we met ; ; Boun My , our interpreter ; ; and myself . Boun My -- the name means one who has a boun , a celebration , and is therefore lucky -- was born in Savannakhet , the Border of Paradise . He had attended three universities in the United States . But he had never seen the mountainous half of his native land north of Vientiane , including the royal capital , Luang Prabang . Before the airplanes came , he said , travel in Laos was just about impossible . Prime minister moves fast Alas , so it almost proved for us , too . To go outside the few cities required permits . And getting them seemed a life's work . Nobody wanted Americans to be hurt or captured , and few soldiers could be spared as escorts . We were told that to the Pathet Lao , a kidnaped American was worth at least $750 , a fortune in Laos . Everyone had heard of the American contractor who had spurned an escort . Now Pathet Lao propagandists were reported marching him barefoot from village to village , as evidence of evil American intervention . Although we enjoyed our rounds of the government offices in Vientiane , with officials offering tea and pleasing conversation in French , we were getting nowhere . We had nearly decided that all the tales of Lao lethargy must be true , when we were invited to take a trip with the Prime Minister . Could we be ready in 15 minutes ? His Highness had decided only two hours ago to go out of town , and he was eager to be off . Prince wears ten-gallon hat And so , after a flight southeast to Savannakhet , we found ourselves bouncing along in a Jeep right behind the Land-Rover of Prince Boun Oum of Champassak , a tall man of Churchillian mien in a bush jacket and a ten-gallon hat from Texas . From his shoulder bag peeked the seven-inch barrel of a Luger . The temperature rose to 105-degrees . With our company of soldiers , we made one long column of reddish dust . In Keng Kok , the City of Silkworms , the Prime Minister bought fried chickens and fried cicadas , and two notebooks for me . Then we drove on , until there was no more road and we traversed dry rice fields , bouncing across their squat earth walls . It was a spleen-crushing day . An hour of bouncing , a brief stop in a village to inspect a new school or dispensary . More bouncing , another stop , a new house for teachers , a new well . Then off again , rushing to keep up . We were miserable . But our two Jeep mates -- Keo Viphakone from Luang Prabang and John Cool from Beaver , Pennsylvania -- were beaming under their coatings of dust . Together they had probably done more than any other men to help push Laos toward the 20th century -- constructively . Mr. Keo , once a diplomat in Paris and Washington , was Commissioner of Rural Affairs . John , an engineer and anthropologist with a doctorate from the London School of Economics , headed the rural development division of USOM , the United States Operations Mission administering U.S. aid . `` What you see are self-help projects '' , John said . `` We ask the people what they want , and they supply the labor . We send shovels , cement , nails , and corrugated iron for roofs . That way they have an infirmary for $400 . We have 2,500 such projects , and they add up to a lot more than just roads and wells and schools . Ask Mr. Keo '' . Mr. Keo agreed . `` Our people have been used to accepting things as they found them '' , he said . `` Where there was no road , they lived without one . Now they learn that men can change their surroundings , through their traditional village elders , without violence . That's a big step toward a modern state . You might say we are in the nation-building business '' . In the villages people lined up to give us flowers . Then came coconuts , eggs , and rice wine . The Prime Minister paid his respects to the Buddhist monks , strode rapidly among the houses , joked with the local soldiery , and made a speech . The soldiers are fighting and the Americans are helping , he said , but in the fight against the Pathet Lao the key factor is the villager himself . Then we were off again . We did it for three days . But our stumping tour of the south wasn't all misery . Crossing the 4,000-foot width of the Mekong at Champassak , on a raft with an outboard motor , we took off our dusty shirts and enjoyed a veritable ocean breeze . Then we hung overboard in the water . Briefly we rolled over a paved road up to Pak Song , on the cool Bolovens Plateau . The Prince visited the hospital of Operation Brotherhood , supported by the Junior Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines , and fed rice to two pet elephants he kept at his residence at Pak Song . Strings keep souls in place In the village of Soukhouma , which means `` Peaceful '' , we had a baci . This is the most endearing of Lao ceremonies . It takes place in the household , a rite of well-wishing for myriad occasions -- for the traveler , a wedding , a newborn child , the sick , the New Year , for any good purpose . The preparations were elaborate : flowers , candles , incense sticks , rice wine , dozens of delicacies , and pieces of white cotton string . The strings were draped around flowers in tall silver bowls ( page 261 ) . The candles were lighted , and we sat on split-bamboo mats among the village notables . I was careful to keep my feet , the seat of the least worthy spirits , from pointing at anyone's head , where the worthiest spirits reside . Now a distinguished old man called on nine divinities to come and join us . Next he addressed himself to our souls . A man has 32 souls , one for each part of the body . Those souls like to wander off , and must be called back . With the divinities present and our souls in place , we were wished health , happiness , and power . Then , one after another , the villagers tied the waiting cotton strings around our wrists . These were to be kept on , to hold in the 32 souls . As we stepped out into the sunlight , a man came up to John Cool and silently showed him his hand . It had a festering hole as big as a silver dollar . We could see maggots moving . John said : `` I have some antiseptic salve with me , but it's too late for that '' . My interviews with teen-agers confirmed this portrait of the weakening of religious and ethnic bonds . Jewish identity was often confused with social and economic strivings . `` Being Jewish gives you tremendous drive '' , a boy remarked . `` It means that you have to get ahead '' . When I pressed for a purely religious definition , I encountered the familiar blend of liberal piety , interfaith good will , and a small residue of ethnic loyalty . `` I like the tradition '' , a girl said . `` I like to follow the holidays when they come along . But you don't have to worship in the traditional way . You can communicate in your own way . As I see it , there's no real difference between being Jewish , Catholic , or Protestant '' . Another teen-ager remarked : `` Most Jews don't believe in God , but they believe in people -- in helping people '' . Still another boy asserted : `` To be a good Jew is to do no wrong ; ; it's to be a good person '' . When asked how this was different from being a good Protestant , the boy answered , `` It's the same thing '' . This accords with the study by Maier and Spinrad . They discovered that , although 42 per cent of a sample of Catholic students and 15 per cent of the Protestants believed it important to live in accordance with the teachings of their religion , only 8 per cent of the Jewish students had this conviction . The most important aims of the Jewish students were as follows : to make the world a better place to live in -- 30 per cent ; ; to get happiness for yourself -- 28 per cent ; ; and financial independence -- 21 per cent . Nevertheless , most of the teen-agers I interviewed believed in maintaining their Jewish identity and even envisioned joining a synagogue or temple . However , they were hostile to Jewish Orthodoxy , professing to believe in Judaism `` but in a moderate way '' . One boy said querulously about Orthodox Jews : `` It's the twentieth century , and they don't have to wear beards '' . The reason offered for clinging to the ancestral faith lacked force and authority even in the teen-agers' minds . `` We were brought up that way '' was one statement which won general assent . `` I want to show respect for my parents' religion '' was the way in which a boy justified his inhabiting a halfway house of Judaism . Still another suggested that he would join a temple `` for social reasons , since I'll be living in a suburb '' . Intermarriage , which is generally regarded as a threat to Jewish survival , was regarded not with horror or apprehension but with a kind of mild , clinical disapproval . Most of the teen-agers I interviewed rejected it on pragmatic grounds . `` When you marry , you want to have things in common '' , a girl said , `` and it's hard when you don't marry someone with your own background '' . A fourteen-year-old girl from the Middle West observed wryly that , in her community , religion inconveniently interfered with religious activities -- at least with the peripheral activities that many middle class Jews now regard as religious . It appears that an Orthodox girl in the community disrupted plans for an outing sponsored by one of the Jewish service groups because she would not travel on Saturday and , in addition , required kosher food . Another girl from a relatively large midwestern city described herself as `` the only Orthodox girl in town '' . This is , no doubt , inaccurate , but it does convey how isolated she feels among the vast army of the nonobservant . The older teens One of the significant things about Jewish culture in the older teen years is that it is largely college-oriented . Sixty-five per cent of the Jewish teen-agers of college age attend institutions of higher learning . This is substantially higher than the figures for the American population at large -- 45.6 per cent for males and 29.2 per cent for females . This may help explain a phenomenon described by a small-town Jewish boy . In their first two years in high school , Jewish boys in this town make strenuous exertions to win positions on the school teams . However , in their junior and senior years , they generally forego their athletic pursuits , presumably in the interest of better academic achievement . It is significant , too , that the older teen-agers I interviewed believed , unlike the younger ones , that Jewish students tend to do better academically than their gentile counterparts . The percentage of Jewish girls who attend college is almost as high as that of boys . The motivations for both sexes , to be sure , are different . The vocational motive is the dominant one for boys , while Jewish girls attend college for social reasons and to become culturally developed . One of the significant developments in American-Jewish life is that the cultural consumers are largely the women . It is they who read -- and make -- Jewish best-sellers and then persuade their husbands to read them . In upper teen Jewish life , the non-college group tends to have a sense of marginality . `` People automatically assume that I'm in college '' , a nineteen-year-old machinist observed irritably . However , among the girls , there are some morale-enhancing compensations for not going to college . The Jewish working girl almost invariably works in an office -- in contradistinction to gentile factory workers -- and , buttressed by a respectable income , she is likely to dress better and live more expansively than the college student . She is even prone to regard the college girl as immature . The lower-middle class college student One of the reasons for the high percentage of Jewish teen-agers in college is that a great many urban Jews are enabled to attend local colleges at modest cost . This is particularly true in large centers of Jewish population like New York , Chicago , and Philadelphia . What is noteworthy about this large group of teen-agers is that , although their attitudes hardly differentiate them from their gentile counterparts , they actually lead their lives in a vast self-enclosed Jewish cosmos with relatively little contact with the non-Jewish world . Perhaps the Jewish students at Brooklyn College -- constituting 85 per cent of those who attend the day session -- can serve as a paradigm of the urban , lower-middle class Jewish student . There is , to begin , an important sex difference . Typically , in a lower-middle class Jewish family , a son will be sent to an out-of-town school , if financial resources warrant it , while the daughter will attend the local college . There are two reasons for this . First , the girl's education has a lower priority than the son's . Second , the attitude in Jewish families is far more protective toward the daughter than toward the son . Most Jewish mothers are determined to exercise vigilance over the social and sexual lives of their daughters by keeping them home . The consequence of this is that the girls at Brooklyn College outnumber the boys and do somewhat better academically . One can assume that some of the brightest boys are out of town . Brooklyn College students have an ambivalent attitude toward their school . On the one hand , there is a sense of not having moved beyond the ambiance of their high school . This is particularly acute for those who attended Midwood High School directly across the street from Brooklyn College . They have a sense of marginality at being denied that special badge of status , the out-of-town school . At the same time , there is a good deal of self-congratulation at attending a good college -- they are even inclined to exaggerate its not inconsiderable virtues -- and they express pleasure at the cozy in-group feeling that the college generates . `` It's people of your own kind '' , a girl remarked . `` You don't have to watch what you say . Of course , I would like to go to an out-of-town school where there are all kinds of people , but I would want lots of Jewish kids there '' . For most Brooklyn College students , college is at once a perpetuation of their ethnic attachments and a breaking away from the cage of neighborhood and family . Brooklyn College is unequivocally Jewish in tone , and efforts to detribalize the college by bringing in unimpeachably midwestern types on the faculty have been unavailing . However , a growing intellectual sophistication and the new certitudes imparted by courses in psychology and anthropology make the students increasingly critical of their somewhat provincial and overprotective parents . And the rebellion of these third generation Jews is not the traditional conflict of culture but , rather , a protest against a culture that they view as softly and insidiously enveloping . `` As long as I'm home , I'll never grow up '' , a nineteen-year-old boy observed sadly . `` They don't like it if I do anything away from home . It's so much trouble , I don't usually bother '' . For girls , the overprotection is far more pervasive . Parents will drive on Friday night to pick up their daughters after a sorority or House Plan meeting . A freshman girl's father not too long ago called a dean at Brooklyn College and demanded the `` low-down '' on a boy who was going out with his daughter . The domestic tentacles even extend to the choice of a major field . Under pressure from parents , the majority of Brooklyn College girls major in education since that co-ordinates best with marriage plans -- limited graduate study requirement and convenient working hours . This means that a great many academically talented girls are discouraged from pursuing graduate work of a more demanding nature . A kind of double standard exists here for Jewish boys and girls as it does in the realm of sex . The breaking away from the prison house of Brooklyn is gradual . First , the student trains on his hapless parents the heavy artillery of his newly acquired psychological and sociological insights . Then , with the new affluence , there is actually a sallying forth into the wide , wide world beyond the precincts of New York . It is significant that the Catskills , which used to be the summer playground for older teen-agers , a kind of summer suburb of New York , no longer attracts them in great numbers -- except for those who work there as waiters , bus boys , or counselors in the day camps . The great world beyond beckons . But it should be pointed out that some of the new watering places -- Fire Island , Nantucket , Westhampton , Long Island , for example -- tend to be homogeneously Jewish . Although Brooklyn College does not yet have a junior-year-abroad program , a good number of students spend summers in Europe . In general , however , the timetable of travel lags considerably behind that of the student at Harvard or Smith . And acculturation into the world at large is likely to occur for the Brooklyn College student after college rather than during the four school years . Brooklyn College is Marjorie Morningstar territory , as much as the Bronx or Central Park West . There are hordes of nubile young women there who , prodded by their impatient mothers , are determined to marry . It is interesting that , although the percentage of married students is not appreciably higher at Brooklyn than elsewhere -- about 30 per cent of the women and 25 per cent of the men in the graduating class -- the anxiety of the unmarried has puffed up the estimate . `` Almost everybody in the senior class is married '' , students say dogmatically . And the school newspaper sells space to jubilant fraternities , sororities , and houses ( in the House Plan Association ) that have good news to impart . These announcements are , in effect , advertisements for themselves as thriving marriage marts . There are boxed proclamations in the newspaper of watchings , pinnings , ringings , engagements , and marriages in a scrupulously graded hierarchy of felicity . `` Witt House happily announces the engagement of Fran Horowitz to Erwin Schwartz of Fife House '' . The Brooklyn College student shows some striking departures from prevailing collegiate models . The Ivy League enjoys no easy dominion here , and the boys are as likely to dress in rather foppish Continental fashion , or even in nondescript working class manner , as they are in the restrained , button-down Ivy way . The girls are prone to dress far more flamboyantly than their counterparts out of town , and eye shadow , mascara , and elaborate bouffant hairdos -- despite the admonitions of cautious guidance personnel -- are not unknown even in early morning classes . Among the boys , there is very little bravado about drinking . Brooklyn College is distinctive for not having an official drinking place . The Fort Lauderdale encampment for drinking is foreign to most Brooklyn College boys . This should be used frequently ( but shaken before using ) . For galled breasts , the mother should shave into half a cup of fresh unsalted lard enough white chalk to make a paste . This could also be used for any other skin irritation . Or she might place cornstarch in the oven for a short time and then apply this under her breasts . `` Female troubles '' of various kinds do not seem to have been common on the frontier ; ; at least I have only one remedy for anything of this kind in my collection , one for hastening delayed menstruation . The sufferer drinks tansy tea . Bruises , burns , cuts , etc. , occurred frequently on the frontier , and folk medicine gave the answers to these problems too . Bruises and black eyes were relieved by application of raw beefsteak . ( Doctors now say that it was not the meat but the coolness of the applications which relieved the pain . ) Salted butter was another cure for bruises . Many people agreed that burns should be treated with bland oily salves or unsalted butter or lard , but one informant told me that a burn should be bathed in salt water ; ; the burn oozed watery fluid for many days , and finally the healing was completed by bathing it with epsom salts . Another swore by vinegar baths for burns , and still another recommended salted butter . `` Butter salve '' or `` butter ointment '' was used for burns , and for bruises as well . This was made by putting butter in a pan of water and allowing it to boil ; ; when it was cool , the fat was skimmed off and bottled . Cow's milk was another cure for burns , and burns covered with gum arabic or plain mucilage healed quickly . One man , badly burned about the face and eyes by an arc welding torch , was blinded and could not find a doctor at the time . A sympathetic friend made poultices of raw potato parings , which she said was the best and quickest way to draw out the `` heat '' . Later the doctor used mineral oil on the burns . The results were good , but which treatment helped is still not known . To stop bleeding , cobwebs were applied to cuts and wounds . One old-timer said to sprinkle sugar on a bleeding cut , even when on a knuckle , if it was made by a rusty tool ; ; this would stop the flow and also prevent infection . My lawyer told me that his mother used a similar remedy for cuts and wounds ; ; she sprinkled common sugar directly on the injury and then bound it loosely with cotton cloth , over which she poured turpentine . He showed me one of his fingers which had been practically amputated and which his mother had treated ; ; there is scarcely a scar showing . Tobacco was common first aid . A `` chaw '' of tobacco put on an open wound was both antiseptic and healing . Or a thin slice of plug tobacco might be laid on the open wound without chewing . One old man told me that when he was a boy he was kicked in the head by a fractious mule and had his scalp laid back from the entire front of his head . His brother ran a mile to get the father ; ; when they reached the boy , the father sliced a new plug of tobacco , put the scalp back in place , and covered the raw edges with the slices . Then he put a rag around the dressing to keep it in place . There was no cleaning or further care , but the wound healed in less than two weeks and showed no scar . Veronica from the herb garden was also used to stop bleeding , and rue was an antiseptic . Until quite recently , `` sterile '' maggots could be bought to apply to a wound ; ; they would feed on its surface , leaving it clean so that it could be medically treated . Tetanus could be avoided by pouring warm turpentine over a wound . One family bound wounds with bacon or salt pork strips , or , if these were not handy , plain lard . Another sprinkled sugar on hot coals and held the wounded foot or hand in the smoke . Rabies were cured or prevented by `` madstones '' which the pioneer wore or carried . In 1872 there were known to be twenty-two in Norton County , and one had been in the family for 200 years . Another cure for hydrophobia was to suck the wounds , then cauterize them with a hot knife or poker . While nowadays we recognize the fact that there are many causes for bleeding at the nose , not long ago a nosebleed was simply that , and treatment had little variation . Since a fall or blow might have caused it , a cold pack was usually first aid . This might be applied to the top of the nose or the back of the neck , pressed on the upper lip , or inserted into the nostril ( cotton was usually used in this last ) . Nosebleed could be stopped by wrapping a red woolen string about the patient's neck and tying it in a knot for each year of his life . Or the victim could chew hard on a piece of paper , meanwhile pressing his fingers tight in his ears . Old sores could be healed by the constant application of a wash made of equal parts vinegar and water . Blood blisters could be prevented from forming by rubbing a work blister immediately with any hard nonpoisonous substance . Felons were cured by taking common salt and drying it in the oven , pounding it fine , and mixing it with equal parts of spirits of turpentine ; ; this mixture was then spread on a cloth and wrapped around the affected part . As the cloth dried , more of the mixture was applied , and after twenty-four hours the felon was supposed to be `` killed '' . Insect bites were cured in many ways . Many an old-timer swore by the saliva method ; ; `` get a bite , spit on it '' was a proverb . This was used also for bruises . Yellow clay was used as a poultice for insect bites and also for swellings ; ; not long ago `` Denver Mud '' was most popular . Chiggers were a common pest along streams and where gardens and berries thrived ; ; so small as to be scarcely visible to the eye , they buried themselves in the victim's flesh . Bathing the itching parts with kerosene gave relief and also killed the pests . Ant bites were eased by applying liquid bluing . For mosquito bites a paste of half a glass of salt and half a glass of soda was made . For wasp stings onion juice , obtained by scraping an onion , gave quick relief . A handier remedy was to bathe the painful part in strong soapy water ; ; mud was sometimes used as well as soap . Just plain old black dirt was also used as a pack to relieve wasp or bee stings . Bedbugs were a common pest in pioneer days ; ; to keep them out of homes , even in the 1900's , was a chore . Bed slats were washed in alum water , legs of beds were placed in cups of kerosene , and all woodwork was treated liberally with corrosive sublimate , applied with a feather . Kerosene was very effective in ridding pioneer homes of the pests . At times pioneer children got lice in their hair . A kerosene shampoo seems a heroic treatment , but it did the job . To remove an insect from one's ear warm water should be inserted . A cinder or other small object could be removed from the eye by placing a flaxseed in the eye . As the seed swelled its glutinous covering protected the eyeball from irritation , and both the cinder and the seed could soon be washed out . Another way to remove small objects from the eye was to have the person look cross-eyed ; ; the particle would then move toward the nose , where it could be wiped out with a wisp of cotton . Shingles were cured by gentian , an old drug , used in combinations . For erysipelas a mixture of one dram borax and one ounce glycerine was applied to the afflicted part on linen cloth . Itching skin , considered `` just nerves '' , was eased by treating with whiskey and salt . Winter itch was treated by applying strong apple cider in which pulverized bloodroot had been steeped . To cure fungus growths on mouth or hands people made a strong tea by using a handful of sassafras bark in a quart of water . They drank half a cup of this morning and night , and they also washed and soaked their hands in the same solution . Six treatments cured one case which lasted a month and had defied other remedies . Frostbite was treated by putting the feet and hands in ice water or by rubbing them with snow . Now one hears that heat and hot water are used instead . Another remedy was oil of eucalyptus , used as well for chilblains . Chilblains were also treated with tincture of capsicum or cabbage leaves . Boils have always been a source of much trouble . A German informant gave me a sure cure made by combining rye flour and molasses into a poultice . Another poultice was made from the inner bark of the elm tree , steeped in water until it formed a sticky , gummy solution . This was also used for sores . Another frequent pioneer difficulty , caused by wearing rough and heavy shoes and boots , was corns . One veracious woman tells me she has used thin potato parings for both corns and calluses on her feet and they remove the pain or `` fire '' . Another common cure was to soak the feet five or ten minutes in warm water , then to apply a solution of equal parts of soda and common brown soap on a kid bandage overnight . This softened the skin so that in the morning when the bandage was removed the corn could be scraped off and a bit of corn plaster put on . There were many cures for warts . One young girl told me how her mother removed a wart from her finger by soaking a copper penny in vinegar for three days and then painting the finger with the liquid several times . Another wart removal method was to rub each wart with a bean split open and then to bury the bean halves under the drip of the house for seven days . Saliva gathered in the mouth after a night's sleep was considered poisonous ; ; wetting a wart with this saliva on wakening the first thing in the morning was supposed to cause it to disappear after only a few treatments , and strangely enough many warts did just that . One wart cure was to wrap it in a hair from a blonde gypsy . Another was to soak raw beef in vinegar for twenty-four hours , tie it on the wart , and wear it for a week . A simpler method was to tie a thread tightly around the wart at its base and wear it this way . I know this worked . One person recommended to me washing the wart with sulphur water ; ; another said it should be rubbed with a cut potato three times daily . Another common method was to cut an onion in two and place each half on the wart for a moment ; ; the onion was then fastened together with string and placed beneath a dripping eave . As the onion decayed , so did the wart . Sore muscles were relieved by an arnica rub ; ; sore feet by calf's-foot , an herb from the pioneer's ubiquitous herb garden , or by soaking the feet in a pan of hot water in which two cups of salt had been dissolved . Leg cramps , one person tells me , were relieved by standing barefoot with the weight of the body on the heel and pressing down hard . This does give relief , as I can testify . One doctor prescribed a tablespoon of whiskey or brandy before each meal for leg cramps . Pains in the back of the leg and in the abdomen were prevented from reaching the upper body by tying a rope about the patient's waist . For sprains and swellings , one pint of cider vinegar and half a pint of spirits of turpentine added to three well beaten eggs was said to give speedy relief . Except for the wine waiter in a restaurant -- always an inscrutable plenipotentiary unto himself , the genii with the keys to unlock the gates of the wine world are one's dealer , and the foreign shipper or negociant who in turn supplies him . In instances where both of these are persons or firms with integrity , the situation is ideal . It may , on occasion , be anything but that . However , by cultivating a wine dealer and accepting his advice , one will soon enough ascertain whether he has any knowledge of wines ( as opposed to what he may have been told by salesmen and promoters ) and , better yet , whether he has a taste for wine . Again , by spreading one's purchases over several wine dealers , one becomes familiar with the names and specialties of reputable wine dealers and shippers abroad . This is important because , despite all the efforts of the French government , an appreciable segment of France's export trade in wines is still tainted with a misrepresentation approaching downright dishonesty , and there are many too many negociants who would rather turn a sou than amass a creditable reputation overseas . A good negociant or shipper will not only be the man or the firm which has cornered the wines from the best vineyards , or the best parts of them ; ; he may also be the one who makes and bottles the best blends -- sound wines from vineyards generally in his own district . These are the wines the French themselves use for everyday drinking , for even in France virtually no one drinks the Grands Crus on a meal-to-meal basis . The Grands Crus are expensive , and even doting palates tire of them . And certainly , in the case of the beginner or the comparatively uninitiated wine drinker , the palate and the capacity for appreciation will not be ready for the Grands Crus as a steady diet without frequent recourse to crus of less renown . There is nothing infra dig about a good blend from a good shipper . Some of them are very delicious indeed , and there are many good ones exported -- unfortunately , along with others not so good , and worse . Consultation with a reputable wine dealer and constant experimentation -- `` steering ever from the known to the unknown '' -- are the requisites . Wine waiters are something else again ; ; especially if one is travelling or dining out a great deal , their importance mounts . Most of them , the world over , operate on the same principle by which justice is administered in France and some other Latin countries : the customer is to be considered guilty of abysmal ignorance until proven otherwise , with the burden of proof on the customer himself . Now the drinking of wine ( and happily so ! ) is for the most part a recondite affair , for manifestly , if everyone in the world who could afford the best wines also liked them , the supply would dry up in no time at all . This is the only valid , and extenuating , argument that may be advanced in defense of the reprehensible attitude of the common wine waiter . A really good wine waiter is , paradoxically , the guardian ( and not the purveyor ) of his cellar against the Visigoths . Faced , on the one hand , with an always exhaustible supply of his best wines , and on the other by a clientele usually equipped with inexhaustible pocketbooks , it is a wonder indeed that all wine waiters are not afflicted with chronic ambivalence . The one way to get around them -- short of knowing exactly what one wants and sticking to it -- is to frequent a single establishment until its wine waiter is persuaded that one is at least as interested in wine as in spending money . Only then , perhaps , will he reveal his jewels and his bargains . Wine bought from a dealer should ideally be allowed to rest for several weeks before it is served . This is especially true of red wines , and a practice which , though not always practicable , is well worth the effort . It does no harm for wine to stand on end for a matter of days , but in terms of months and years it is fatal . Wine stored for a long time should be on its side ; ; otherwise , the cork dries and air enters to spoil it . When stacking wine on its side in a bin , care should always be taken to be sure there is no air bubble left next to the cork . Fat bottles , such as Burgundies , have a way of rolling around in the bin and often need little props , such as a bit of cardboard or a chip of wood , to hold them in the proper reclining posture . Too much dampness in the cellar rots the corks , again with ill effects . The best rule of thumb for detecting corked wine ( provided the eye has not already spotted it ) is to smell the wet end of the cork after pulling it : if it smells of wine , the bottle is probably all right ; ; if it smells of cork , one has grounds for suspicion . Seasonal rises or drops in temperature are bad for wine : they age it prematurely . The ideal storage temperature for long periods is about fifty-five degrees , with an allowable range of five degrees above or below this , provided there are no sudden or frequent changes . Prolonged vibration is also undesirable ; ; consequently , one's wine closet or cellar should be away from machines or electrically driven furnaces . If one lives near a subway or an express parkway , the solution is to have one's wines stored with a dealer and brought home a few at a time . Light , especially daylight , is always bad for wine . All in all , though , there is a good deal of nonsense expended over the preparations thought necessary for ordinary wine drinking ; ; many people go to extreme lengths in decanting , chilling or warming , or banishing without further investigation any bottle with so much as a slightly suspicious cork . No one should wish to deny these purists the obvious pleasure they derive from all this , and to give fair warning where warning is due , no one who becomes fond of wines ever avoids acquiring some degree of purism ! But the fact remains that in most restaurants , including some of the best of Paris and Bordeaux and Dijon , the bottle is frankly and simply brought from the cellar to the table when ordered , and all the conditioning or preparation it ever receives takes place while the chef is preparing the meal . A white wine , already at cool cellar temperature , may be adequately chilled in a bucket of ice and water or the freezing compartment of a refrigerator ( the former is far preferable ) in about fifteen minutes ; ; for those who live in a winter climate , there is nothing better than a bucket of water and snow . Though by no means an ideal procedure , a red wine may similarly be brought from the cellar to the dining room and opened twenty minutes or so before serving time . It may be a bit cold when poured ; ; but again , as one will have observed at any restaurant worth its salt , wine should be served in a large , tulip-shaped glass , which is never filled more than half full . In this way , red wine warms of itself quite rapidly -- and though it is true that it may not attain its potential of taste and fragrance until after the middle of the meal ( or the course ) , in the meantime it will have run the gamut of many beguiling and interesting stages . The only cardinal sin which may be committed in warming a wine is to force it by putting it next to the stove or in front of an open fire . This invariably effaces any wine's character , and drives its fragrance underground . It should not be forgotten that wines mature fastest in half-bottles , less fast in full bottles , slowly in Magnums -- and slower yet in Tregnums , double Magnums , Jeroboams , Methuselahs , and Imperiales , respectively . Very old red wines often require several hours of aeration , and any red wine , brought from the cellar within half an hour of mealtime , should be uncorked and allowed some air . But white wines never ! White wines should be opened when served , having been previously chilled in proportion to their sweetness . Thus , Sauternes or Barsacs should be very cold ; ; a Pouilly-Fuisse or a Chablis somewhat less cold . Over-chilling is an accepted method for covering up the faults of many a cheap or poor white wine , especially a dry wine -- and certainly less of a crime than serving a wine at a temperature which reveals it as unattractive . The fragrance and taste of any white wine will die a lingering death when it is allowed to warm or is exposed for long to the air . To quote Professor Saintsbury : `` The last glass of claret or Burgundy is as good as the first ; ; but the first glass of Chateau d'Yquem or Montrachet is a great deal better than the last '' ! This does not mean , though , that a red wine improves with prolonged aeration : there is a reasonable limit -- and wines kept over to the next meal or the next day , after they have once been opened , are never as good . If this must be done , they should always be corked and kept in a cool place ; ; it should be remembered that their lasting qualities are appreciably shorter than those of milk . A few red wines , notably those of the Beaujolais , are better consumed at cellar temperature . By tradition , a red wine should be served at approximately room temperature -- if anything a little cooler -- and be aged enough for the tannin and acids to have worked out and the sediment have settled well . Thus , red wine must , if possible , never be disturbed or shaken ; ; very old red wine is often decanted so that the puckering , bitter elements which have settled to the bottom will not be mingled with the wine itself . A tug-of-war between an old bottle and an inefficient corkscrew may do as much harm as a week at sea . The cork should be pulled gradually and smoothly , and the lip of the bottle wiped afterward . Many people use wicker cradles for old red wine , lifting the bottle carefully from the bin into the cradle and eventually to the table , without disturbing the sediment . Another school frowns on such a shortcut , and insists that after leaving the bin an old red wine should first stand on end for several days to allow the sediment to roll to the very bottom , after which the bottle may be gently eased to a tilted position on its side in the cradle . In France , when one wishes to entertain at a restaurant and serve truly fine old red wines , one visits the restaurant well ahead of time , chooses the wines and , with the advice of the manager and his chef , builds the menu around them . The wine waiter will see to it that the bottles are taken from the bin and opened at least in time to warm and aerate , preferably allowed to stand on end for as long as possible and , perhaps in the case of very old wines , be decanted . Decanting old wine aerates it fully ; ; it may also be -- practically speaking -- a matter of good economy . For , in the process of decanting , the bottle is only tilted once instead of several or more times at the table : hence , a minimum of the undesirable mixture of wine and dregs . Though there are many exceptions , which we have noted in preceding pages , white wine is as a rule best consumed between two and six years old , and red wines , nowadays , between three and ten . Red wines of good years tend to mature later and to keep longer ; ; the average claret is notably longer-lived than its opposite number , red Burgundy . Some clarets do not come into their own until they are ten or fifteen years of age , or even more . If a red Bordeaux of a good name and year is bitter or acid , or cloying and muddy-tasting , leave it alone for a while . Most of the wines of Beaujolais , on the other hand , should be drunk while very young ; ; and Alsatians may be . Giffen replied punctually and enthusiastically : `` Rest assured that your accompanying Letter of Instructions shall be in the Letter and Spirit strictly complied with and most particularly in regard to that part of them relative to the completion of your noble and humane views '' . Giffen lost no time in visiting the plantation . The slaves appeared to be in good health and at work under John Palfrey's overseer . An excellent crop was expected that year . William , who lived in neighboring St. Mary's parish , had taken charge and decided that it would be best for all if the plantation were operated for another year . Giffen advised acceptance of this plan , citing the depressed market for land then prevailing and the large stock of provisions at the plantation . If sold then , the land and improvements might bring only $5,000 . Early in January , 1844 he had a conference with Henry and William in New Orleans , and upon learning of Gorham's intention , Henry remonstrated calmly but firmly with his brother . The emancipation plan would not only be injurious to all the heirs , he contended , but would be a form of cruelty perpetrated on the hapless Negroes . They were not capable of supporting themselves off the plantation , and Louisiana law required their removal from the state . Gorham refused to accept money for slave property , but did he realize how much expense and trouble the transportation of his Negroes to the North involved ? The suggestion that Giffen hire out the slaves was not realistic , since no planter would take the risk of having Negroes who knew they were to be free living with his own slaves . Henry hid his annoyance , although both he and William were furious with their Yankee brother . William , who did not write to Gorham , told Giffen that unless he could operate the plantation as usual for a year , he would sue `` amicably '' to protect his interests . Palfrey was determined that his portion of the slaves be converted to wage laborers during the transition period before emancipation . If William wished to continue operations for a year , why not simply leave the Negroes undisturbed and pay them `` as high wages to remain there as are ever paid the labor of persons of their sex & age . A disposition to exert themselves for my benefit would perhaps be a motive with some of them to come into the scheme . Their having family ties on our plantation & the adjoining one would be a stronger inducement '' . When he heard of his brothers' anger , Palfrey was still hopeful that they could be persuaded to accept his notion of paying wages . If not , he was willing to accede to William's wishes in any way that did not block his ultimate aim . William was adamant on one point : under no circumstances would he allow the Negroes to remain on the plantation with his and Henry's slaves if they were told of their coming freedom . Knowing the antipathy that existed in Louisiana against increasing the number of free Negroes , Giffen suggested that Palfrey bring them to Boston at once , and then send them on to Liberia . Lacking specific instructions , he agreed to William's condition . In March there was a division of the slaves , and Giffen carried out his instructions as nearly as possible . Of the fifty-two slaves , Giffen succeeded in getting a lot of twenty , twelve of whom were females . `` I considered that your views would be best carried out '' , he explained , `` by taking women whose progeny will of course be free & more fully extend the philantrophy of Emancipation . I have also taken the old servants of your father as a matter of Conscience & Justice '' . The ages of the slaves ranged from sixty-five , for an old house servant , to an unnamed newborn child . If Palfrey ever had any doubts about the wickedness of slavery , they were put aside after he received an inventory of the slave property he had inherited . This cold reckoning of human worth in a legal paper , devoid of compassion or humanity , was all he needed . Each human being , known only by a given name , had a cash value . Old Sam's sixty-five years had reduced his value to $150 ; ; ; ; Rose , a twelve-year-old with child-bearing potential , was worth $400 . In rejecting any claim to the value of the slave property , Palfrey was giving up close to $7,000 . Palfrey's brothers each received lots of sixteen Negroes , and for bookkeeping purposes it was agreed that all lots were to be valued at $6,666.66 . Thus twenty `` black souls '' were to remain ignorant of their imminent journey to the land of free men . Giffen extracted one concession from William : the house servants could be free at any time Gorham thought expedient . Despite Giffen's warning , Palfrey still had plans for freeing his slaves in Louisiana . Yet even if he could get the necessary approval , fourteen of his Negroes could not be manumitted without special permission . According to state law a slave had to be at least thirty years old before he could be freed . Palfrey petitioned the state legislature to waive the requirement . Otherwise , freedom would mean removal from the state in which `` as the place of their past residence from birth , or for many years , it would be materially for their advantage to be at liberty to remain '' . On March 11 the Louisiana legislature voted unanimously to table the petition . News of the legislative veto appeared in the New Orleans papers , and Henry and William became incensed by the fact that they had not been told of the attempt in advance . Henry stormed into Giffen's office waving a copy of the New Orleans Courier , shouting that the emancipation scheme had become a public affair , and that it would reach the `` Ears of the People on the Plantation , and make them restless & unhappy '' . His brothers' anger caused Palfrey genuine concern , for he had imposed a dual mission upon himself : to free his slaves , and to keep the family from falling apart over the issue . When Giffen decided to charge him interest on the loan from John Palfrey , Gorham readily assented , vowing that in a matter of dollars and cents , his brothers would never have any cause to complain of him . In view of these difficulties , Palfrey decided to go to Louisiana . Giffen had already urged him to journey south , if only for a few days to clear up matters . His duties as Massachusetts Secretary of State obliged him to wait until the adjournment of the legislature in mid-April . Palfrey told his wife of his intentions for the first time , and left for New Orleans apprehensively invoking a special blessing of Providence that he might be allowed to see his family again . During his journey Palfrey stopped off to see two abolitionists . In both cases he desired information about placing the freedmen in homes once they arrived in the North . In New York , Lydia Maria Child welcomed him enthusiastically : `` I have lately heard of you from the Legislature of Louisiana , and felt joy at your public recognition of the brotherhood of man '' . Mrs. Child , who had once apologized for sending editor Palfrey a book on slavery , now confided that she had helped one of Henry Palfrey's slaves escape to Canada some years before , but asked him not to advertise the fact in Louisiana . She agreed to take charge of five or six of the Negroes should Palfrey decide to send them north immediately . At Lexington , Kentucky , Palfrey consulted with Cassius M. Clay on the same subject , but with no apparent result . Despite his apprehensions about his personal safety , Palfrey's reception in New Orleans was more than cordial . Instead of the expected `` annoyances '' due to the nature of his mission , he received many calling cards and invitations from `` gentlemen of mark , on whom I had no sort of claim , & have had many more invitations than I could accept '' . He later told abolitionist Edmund Quincy of the `` marked attention and civility '' with which the New Orleans gentlemen and the upriver planters greeted him . The memory of this southern hospitality did not survive the trials of coming antislavery years and Civil War . Palfrey's autobiography contains a melodramatic account of two perilous days spent among the planters of Attakapas , `` many of whom were coarse & passionate people , much excited by what they heard of my plans '' . He proceeded with his task bravely -- in his memoirs , at least -- before the `` passions of my neighbors should have time to boil too high '' . Palfrey had already made up his mind that he would allow the men , but not the women , to choose freely whether or not to go North for freedom . The women by remaining behind condemned their children , born and unborn , to bondage . He had a short private talk with each adult slave . Only one objected , but Palfrey soon convinced him that he ought to go with the others . All the slaves joined in requesting that they be allowed to delay their departure until the end of the planting season , so that they could get in `` their own little produce '' . Palfrey agreed ; ; the slaves were to remain as wage laborers for his account . William's threat that under no conditions would he allow `` freedom-conscious '' slaves to mix with his own was not carried out , for the plantation continued in operation as before . Palfrey returned to Massachusetts greatly relieved to have made an arrangement `` so satisfactory to my judgment & my conscience '' . From Cambridge , Palfrey maintained a close interest in the welfare of his slaves . In fact , as the time for their departure approached , his solicitousness increased . Should any slave change his mind and request to leave earlier , Giffen was to provide passage at once . When a sailing date of March , 1845 was finally established , Palfrey made sure that the Negroes would have comfortable quarters in New Orleans and aboard ship . Giffen assured him that the captain and his mate had personally promised to treat the Negroes with consideration . Palfrey was also concerned about the question of what wage to pay for their labor throughout 1844 . The plantation was sold in January , 1845 , and Palfrey thought the new owner ought to pay his people two months' wages . Giffen suggested fifty dollars as fair compensation for a year's work ; ; the new owner at Attakapas declined to enter into any philanthropic arrangement . On March 21 , 1845 the bark Bashaw weighed anchor at New Orleans , while on the levee Henry and William Palfrey waved farewell to their father's former chattels who must have looked back at the receding shore with mingled regret and jubilation . Not all of Palfrey's slaves were aboard the Bashaw . Giffen had advised that it would not be too difficult to obtain freedom locally for the old house servants . Two of these were included in Palfrey's lot . Giffen filed a petition for permission to emancipate four slaves ( all more than fifty years old ) with the St. Martin's Parish Police Jury . After an initial rejection , which he attributed to a `` general Excitement against Abolition and Emancipation '' , Giffen bribed the right individuals on the jury , and got the permission without further delay . When the Negroes landed at Boston a month later they were , of course , no longer slaves . Slavery was prohibited in Massachusetts by the terms of the constitution of 1780 , which declared `` all men are born free and equal '' . Nevertheless , Palfrey arranged a religious ceremony at King's Chapel to formalize the emancipation . An eyewitness recalled how awkward the red-turbaned colored women appeared as they curtseyed in the church doorway , and the diffidence the former slaves displayed while they listened to the few words that declared them free . Once the question of emancipation was settled to Palfrey's satisfaction , he faced a real problem in placing the freedmen in suitable homes as servants . Palfrey tried fruitlessly to place a Negro boy in the Hopedale Community , but he had better luck in his other attempts . Mrs. Child , true to her word , helped place Anna and her four children with a Quaker family named Hathaway near Canandaigua , New York . This group had been Palfrey's greatest worry since Anna was in bad health , and her children were too young to work for their keep . But certainly the New Frontier has brought to Washington a group more varied in background and interest . Secretary of State Dean Rusk , a former Rhodes Scholar and Mills College dean , has headed the Rockefeller Foundation and in that role expended large sums for international cultural exchange . One of his initial acts in office was to appoint Philip Coombs of the Ford Foundation as the first Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs . ( `` In the late forties and fifties '' , Coombs has declared in defining his role , `` two strong new arms were added to reinforce United States foreign policy economic assistance and military assistance . As we embark upon the sixties we have an opportunity to build a third strong arm , aimed at the development of people , at the fuller realization of their creative human potential , and a better understanding among them '' . ) Many of the new appointees are art collectors . Ambassador-at-Large Averell Harriman has returned to the capital with a collection of paintings that include Renoir , Cezanne , Gauguin , Van Gogh , Toulouse-Lautrec , Degas , Matisse , Picasso , and Walt Kuhn . The Director of the Peace Corps , R. Sargent Shriver , Jr. , a Kennedy brother-in-law , collects heavily among the moderns , including Kenzo Okada and Josef Albers . Secretary of the Treasury Douglas Dillon owns a prize Monet , Femmes dans un Jardin . Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara , former President of the Ford Motor Company , comes from a generation different from that of Eisenhower's own first Secretary of Defense , Charles Wilson , who had been head of General Motors . Unlike Wilson , who at times seemed almost anti-intellectual in his earthy pragmatism . McNamara is the scholar-businessman . An inveterate reader of books , he chose while working in Detroit to live in the University community of Ann Arbor , almost forty miles away . He selected as Comptroller of Defense , not a veteran accountant , but a former Rhodes Scholar , Charles Hitch , who is author of a study on The Economics Of Defense In The Nuclear Age . One of the President's special assistants , the Harvard dean McGeorge Bundy , was co-author with Henry L. Stimson of the latter's classic memoir , On Active Service . Another , Arthur M. Schlesinger , Jr. , has won a Pulitzer Prize in history ; ; his wife , Marion , is a portrait painter . The Press Secretary , Pierre Salinger , was a child prodigy as a pianist . ( `` It is always of sorrow to me when I find people who neither know nor understand music '' , he declared not long ago in proposing that White House prizes be awarded for music and art . ) Mrs. Arthur Goldberg , wife of the Secretary of Labor , paints professionally and helps sponsor the Associated Artists' Gallery in the District of Columbia . ( `` Artists are always at a new frontier '' , she claims . `` In fact , the search is almost more important than the find '' . ) Mrs. Henry Labouisse , wife of the new director of the foreign aid program , is the writer and lecturer Eve Curie . The list goes on . At last count , sixteen former Rhodes Scholars ( see box on page 13 ) had been appointed to the Administration , second in number only to its Harvard graduates . Besides Schlesinger , the Justice Department's Information Director , Edwin Guthman , has won a Pulitzer Prize ( for national reporting ) . Postmaster General J. Edward Day , who must deal with matters of postal censorship , is himself author of a novel , Bartholf Street , albeit one he was obliged to publish at his own expense . Two men show promise of playing prominent roles : William Walton , a writer-turned-painter , has been a long-time friend of the President . They arrived in Washington about the same time during the early postwar years : Kennedy as the young Congressman from Massachusetts ; ; Walton , after a wartime stint with Time-Life , to become bureau chief for The New Republic . Both lived in Georgetown , were unattached , and shared an active social life . Walton , who soon made a break from journalism to become one of the capital's leading semi-abstract painters , vows that he and Kennedy never once discussed art in those days . Nonetheless , they found common interests . During last year's campaign , Kennedy asked Walton , an utter novice in organization politics , to assist him . Walton dropped everything to serve as a district co-ordinator in the hard-fought Wisconsin primary and proved so useful that he was promoted to be liaison officer to critically important New York City . Walton , who served as a correspondent with General James Gavin's paratroopers during the invasion of France , combines the soul of an artist with the lingo of a tough guy . He provoked outraged editorials when , after a post-Inaugural inspection of the White House with Mrs. Kennedy , he remarked to reporters , `` We just cased the joint to see what was there '' . But his credentials are impeccable . Already the President and the First Lady have deputized him to advise on matters ranging from the furnishing of the White House to the renovation of Lafayette Square . A man of great talent , he will continue to serve as a sort of Presidential trouble-shooter , strictly ex officio , for culture . A more official representative is the Secretary of the Interior . Udall , who comes from one of the Mormon first-families of Arizona , is a bluff , plain-spoken man with a lust for politics and a habit of landing right in the middle of the fight . But even while sparring furiously with Republican politicians , he displays a deep and awesome veneration for anyone with cultural attainments . His private dining room has become a way station for visiting intellectuals such as C. P. Snow , Arnold Toynbee , and Aaron Copland . Udall argues that Interior affairs should cover a great deal more than dams and wildlife preserves . After promoting Frost's appearance at the Inauguration , he persuaded the poet to return several months later to give a reading to a select audience of Cabinet members , members of Congress , and other Washington notables gathered in the State Department auditorium . The event was so successful that the Interior Secretary plans to serve as impresario for similar ones from time to time , hoping thereby to add to the cultural enrichment of the Administration . His Ideas in this respect , however , sometimes arouse critical response . One tempest was stirred up last March when Udall announced that an eight-and-a-half-foot bronze statue of William Jennings Bryan , sculpted by the late Gutzon Borglum , would be sent `` on indefinite loan '' to Salem , Illinois , Bryan's birthplace . Spokesmen for the nation's tradition-minded sculptors promptly claimed that Udall was exiling the statue because of his own hostility to this art form . They dug up a speech he had made two years earlier as a Congressman , decrying the more than two hundred statues , monuments , and memorials which `` dot the Washington landscape as patriotic societies and zealous friends are constantly hatching new plans '' . Hoping to cut down on such works , Udall had proposed that a politician be at least fifty years departed before he is memorialized . He is not likely to win this battle easily . In the case of the Borglum statue an Interior aide was obliged to announce that there had been a misunderstanding and that the Secretary had no desire to `` hustle '' it out of Washington . The last Congress adopted seven bills for memorials , including one to Taras Shevchenko , the Ukrainian poet laureate ; ; eleven others were introduced . Active warfare is raging between the forces pressing for a monument to the first Roosevelt on Theodore Roosevelt Island in the Potomac , and TR.'s own living children , who wish to preserve the island as a wildlife sanctuary . The hotly debated plan for the capital's Franklin D. Roosevelt Memorial , a circle of huge tablets engraved with his speeches ( and promptly dubbed by one of its critics , `` Instant Stonehenge '' ) , is another of Udall's headaches , since as supervisor of the National Parks Commission he will share in the responsibility for building it . `` Washington '' , President Kennedy has been heard to remark ironically , `` is a city of southern efficiency and northern charm '' . There have been indications that he hopes to redress that situation , commencing with the White House . One of Mrs. Kennedy's initial concerns as First Lady was the sad state of the furnishings in a building which is supposed to be a national shrine . Ever since the fire of 1812 destroyed the beautiful furniture assembled by President Thomas Jefferson , the White House has collected a hodgepodge of period pieces , few of them authentic or aesthetic . Mrs. Kennedy shows a determination to change all this . Not long after moving in she turned up a richly carved desk , hewed from the timbers of the British ship H.M.S. Resolute and presented to President Hayes by Queen Victoria . It now serves the President in his oval office . Later , browsing in an old issue of the Gazette Des Beaux-Arts , she found a description of a handsome gilt pier-table purchased in 1817 by President James Monroe . She traced it to a storage room . With its coating of gold radiator paint removed -- a gaucherie of some earlier tenant -- it will now occupy its rightful place in the oval Blue Room on the first floor of the White House . But it soon became clear that the search for eighteenth-century furniture ( which Mrs. Kennedy feels is the proper period for the White House ) must be pursued in places other than government storage rooms . The First Lady appointed a Fine Arts Advisory Committee for the White House , to locate authentic pieces as well as to arrange ways to acquire them . Her effort to put the home of living Presidents on the same basis as Mount Vernon and Monticello recognizes no party lines . By rough estimate her Committee , headed by Henry Francis Du Pont , contains three times as many Republicans as Democrats . The press releases emanating from the White House give a clue to the activity within . A curator has been appointed . A valuable pencil-and-sepia allegorical drawing of Benjamin Franklin by Jean-Honore Fragonard has been donated by the art dealer Georges Wildenstein and now hangs in the Blue Room . The American Institute of Interior Designers is redecorating the White House library . Secretary and Mrs. Dillon have contributed enough pieces of Empire furniture , including Dolley Madison's own sofa , to furnish a room in that style . And part of a fabulous collection of vermeil hollowware , bequeathed to the White House by the late Mrs. Margaret Thompson Biddle , has been taken out of its locked cases and put on display in the State dining room . Woman's place is in the home : man must attend to matters of the yard . One of the vexatious problems to first confront President Kennedy was the property lying just across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House . Congress had already appropriated money , and plans were well along to tear down the buildings flanking Lafayette Square and replace them with what one critic calls the `` marble monumentality '' of government office buildings . While a Senator , Kennedy had unsuccessfully pushed a bill to preserve the Belasco Theater , as well as the Dolley Madison and the Benjamin Taylor houses , all scheduled for razing . What to do about it now that he was President ? Only a few days after moving into the White House . Kennedy made a midnight inspection of the Square . Then he called in his friend Walton and turned over the problem to him , with instructions to work out what was best -- provided it didn't pile unnecessary burdens on the President . The situation involved some political perils . One of the offices slated for reconstruction is the aged Court of Claims , diagonally across the street from the White House . Logically , it should be moved downtown . But Judge Marvin Jones , senior member of the Court , is an elderly gentleman who lives at the nearby Metropolitan Club and desires to walk to work . More importantly , he also happens to be the brother-in-law of Sam Rayburn , Speaker of the House . There were aesthetic problems as well as political . On delving deeper , Walton discovered that most of the buildings fronting the Square could be classified as `` early nondescript '' . The old Belasco Theater , over which many people had grown sentimental , was only a shell of its former self after arduous years as a USO Center . The Dolley Madison House , Walton concluded , was scarcely worth preserving . `` The attempt to save the Square's historic value '' , he declares , `` came half a century too late '' . Surrounded by ancient elms , the campus is spacious and beautiful . The buildings are mostly Georgian . The Dartmouth student does not live in monastic seclusion , as he once did . But his is still a simple life relatively free of the female presence or influence , and he must go far , even though he may go fast , for sophisticated pleasures . He is still heir to the rare gifts of space and silence , if he chooses to be . He is by no means the country boy he might have been in the last century , down from the hills with bear grease on his hair and a zeal for book learning in his heart . The men's shops on Hanover's Main Street compare favorably with those in Princeton and New Haven . And the automobiles that stream out of Hanover each weekend , toward Smith and Wellesley and Mount Holyoke , are no less rakish than those leaving Cambridge or West Philadelphia . But there has always been an outdoor air to Dartmouth . The would-be sophisticate and the citybred youth adopt this air without embarrassment . No one here pokes fun at manly virtues . And this gives rise to an easy camaraderie probably unequaled elsewhere in the Ivy League . It even affects the faculty . Thus , when Dartmouth's Winter Carnival -- widely recognized as the greatest , wildest , roaringest college weekend anywhere , any time -- was broadcast over a national television hookup , Prexy John Sloan Dickey appeared on the screen in rugged winter garb , topped off by a tam-o'-shanter which he confessed had been acquired from a Smith girl . President Dickey's golden retriever , frolicking in the snow at his feet , added to the picture of masculine informality . This carefree disdain for `` side '' cropped up again in the same television broadcast . Dean Thaddeus Seymour , wearing ski clothes , was crowning a beauteous damsel queen of the Carnival . She must have looked temptingly pretty to the dean as he put the crown on her head . So he kissed her . No Dartmouth man was surprised . Dartmouth students enjoy other unusual diversions with equal sang-froid . For example , groups regularly canoe down the Connecticut River . This is in honor of John Ledyard , class of 1773 , who scooped a canoe out of a handy tree and first set the course way back in his own student days . And these hardy travelers are not unappreciated today . They are hailed by the nation's press , and Smith girls throng the riverbanks at Northampton and refresh the voyageurs with hot soup and kisses . Dartmouth's favorite and most characteristic recreation is skiing . Since the days when their two thousand pairs of skis outnumbered those assembled anywhere else in the United States , the students have stopped regarding the Olympic Ski Team as another name for their own . Yet Dartmouth still is the dominant member of the Intercollegiate Ski Union , which includes the winter sports colleges of Canada as well as those of this country . Dartmouth students ski everywhere in winter , starting with their own front door . They can hire a horse and go ski-joring behind him , or move out to Oak Hill , where there's a lift . The Dartmouth Skiway , at Holt's Ledge , ten miles north of the campus , has one of the best terrains in the East , ranging from novice to expert . Forty miles farther north is Mount Moosilauke , Dartmouth's own mountain . Here , at the Ravine Lodge , President Dickey acts as host every year to about a hundred freshmen who are being introduced by the Dartmouth Outing Club to life on the trails . The Lodge , built of hand-hewn virgin spruce , can handle fifty people for dining , sleeping , or lounging in its huge living room . The Outing Club also owns a chain of fourteen cabins and several shelters , extending from the Vermont hills , just across the river from the college , through Hanover to the College Grant -- 27,000 acres of wilderness 140 miles north up in the logging country . The cabins are equipped with bunks , blankets , and cooking equipment and are ideal bases for hikes and skiing trips . The club runs regular trips to the cabins , but many of the students prefer to take off in small unofficial groups for a weekend of hunting , fishing , climbing , or skiing . Under the auspices of the Outing Club , Dartmouth also has the Mountaineering Club , which takes on tough climbs like Mount McKinley , and Bait & Bullet , whose interests are self-evident , and even sports a Woodman's Team , which competes with other New England colleges in wood sawing and chopping , canoe races , and the like . There is much to be said for a college that , while happily attuned to the sophisticated Ivies , still gives its students a chance to get up early in the morning and drive along back roads where a glimpse of small game , deer , or even bear is not uncommon . City boys find a lot of learning in the feel of an ax handle or in the sharp tang of a sawmill , come upon suddenly in a backwoods logging camp . And on the summit of Mount Washington , where thirty-five degrees below zero is commonplace and the wind velocity has registered higher than anywhere else in the world , there is a kind of wisdom to be found that other men often seek in the Himalayas `` because it is there '' . There is much to be said for such a college -- and Dartmouth men have been accused of saying it too often and too loudly . Their affection for their college home has even caused President Dickey to comment on this `` place loyalty '' as something rather specially Hanoverian . Probably a lawyer once said it best for all time in the Supreme Court of the United States . Early in the nineteenth century the State of New Hampshire was casting about for a way to found its own state university . It fixed on Dartmouth College , which was ready-made and just what the proctor ordered . The legislators decided to `` liberate '' Dartmouth and entered into a tug-o'-war with the college trustees over the control of classrooms , faculty , and chapel . For a time there were two factions on the campus fighting for possession of the student body . The struggle was resolved in 1819 in the Supreme Court in one of the most intriguing cases in our judicial history . In 1817 the lawyers were generally debating the legal inviolability of private contracts and charters . A lawyer , hired by the college , was arguing specifically for Dartmouth : Daniel Webster , class of 1801 , made her plight the dramatic focus of his whole plea . In an age of oratory , he was the king of orators , and both he himself and Chief Justice Marshall were bathed in manly tears , as Uncle Dan'l reached his thundering climax : `` It is , sir , as I have said , a small college , and yet there are those who love it . '' Dartmouth is today still a small college -- and still a private one , thanks to Webster's eloquence . This is not out of keeping with its origins , probably the most humble of any in the Ivy group . Eleazar Wheelock , a Presbyterian minister , founded the school in 1769 , naming it after the second earl of Dartmouth , its sponsor and benefactor . Eleazar , pausing on the Hanover plain , found its great forests and remoteness good and with his own hands built the first College Hall , a log hut dedicated `` for the education & instruction of Youth of the Indian Tribes in this Land in reading , writing & all parts of learning which shall appear necessary and expedient for civilizing & christianizing Children of Pagans as well as in all liberal Arts and Sciences ; ; and also of English Youth and any others '' . It was a hardy undertaking , and Wheelock's was indeed `` a voice crying in the wilderness '' . A road had to be hacked through trackless forests between Hanover and Portsmouth to permit Governor Wentworth and a company of gentlemen to attend the first Dartmouth commencement in 1771 . The governor and his retinue thoughtfully brought with them a glorious silver punchbowl which is still one of the cherished possessions of the college . The exuberance on this occasion set a standard for subsequent Dartmouth gatherings . A student orator `` produced tears from a great number of the learned '' even before the punch was served . Then from the branches of a near-by tree an Indian underclassman , disdaining both the platform and the English language , harangued the assemblage in his aboriginal tongue . Governor Wentworth contributed an ox for a barbecue on the green beneath the three-hundred-foot pines , and a barrel of rum was broached . The cook got drunk , and President Wheelock proved to be a man of broad talents by carving the ox himself . Future commencements were more decorous perhaps , but the number of graduates increased from the original four at a relatively slow pace . By the end of the nineteenth century , in 1893 , when the Big Three , Columbia , and Penn were populous centers of learning , Dartmouth graduated only sixty-nine . The dormitories , including the beloved Dartmouth Hall , could barely house two hundred students in Spartan fashion . Then in 1893 Dr. William Jewett Tucker became president and the college's great awakening began . He transformed Dartmouth from a small New Hampshire institution into a national college . By 1907 the number of undergraduates had risen to 1,107 . And at his last commencement , in that year , Dr. Tucker and Dartmouth were honored by the presence of distinguished academic visitors attesting to the new stature of the college . The presidents of Cornell , Wisconsin , C.C.N.Y. , Bowdoin , Vermont , Brown , Columbia , Princeton , Yale , and Harvard and the presidents emeritus of Harvard and Michigan were there . Dartmouth is numerically still a small college today , with approximately twenty-nine hundred undergraduates . But it has achieved a cross-section of students from almost all the states , and two-thirds of its undergraduates come from outside New England . Over 450 different schools are usually represented in each entering class . Only a dozen or so schools send as many as six students , and there are seldom more than fifteen men in any single delegation . About two-thirds of the boys now come from public schools . It is still a college only and not a university ; ; it is , in fact , the only college in the Ivy group . However , three distinguished associated graduate schools offer professional curriculums -- the Dartmouth Medical School ( third oldest in the country and founded in 1797 ) , the Thayer School of Engineering , and the Amos Tuck School of Business Administration . All three are purposely kept small , with a current total enrollment of about two hundred . All three schools coordinate their educational programs with that of the undergraduate college and , like the college proper , place emphasis upon a broad liberal arts course as the proper foundation for specialized study . Students of the college who are candidates for the A.B. degree and can satisfy the academic requirements of the medical and business schools , may enter either of these associated schools at the beginning of senior year , thus completing the two-year postgraduate course in one year . The Thayer School offers a year of postgraduate study in somewhat the same way , after a boy wins a B.S. in engineering . So Dartmouth is moving closer to the others in the Ivy group . It is still , however , the junior member of the League , if not in years at least in the catching up it has had to do . It has not been a well-known school for any part of the span the other Ivies have enjoyed . However much football has been over-emphasized , the public likes to measure its collegiate favorites by the scoreboard , so , while Yale need never give its record a thought again since outscoring its opponents 694 to 0 in the season of 1888 , Dartmouth had to wait until its championship team of 1925 for national recognition . It has come on with a rush in more significant areas . Today it espouses certain ideas in its curriculum that other institutions might consider somewhat breathtaking . But Dartmouth preserves its youthful brashness even in its educational attitudes , and , although some of its experiments may still be in the testing stage , they make for lively copy . President Emeritus Hopkins once proposed to corral an `` aristocracy of brains '' in Hanover . The person who left the buggy there has never been identified . It was a busy street , conveniently near the shopping center , and unattended horses and wagons were often left at the curbside . There are , of course , many weaknesses in any case against Emma . She didn't like her stepmother , but nothing is known to have occurred shortly before the crime that could have caused such a murderous rage . She had no way of knowing in advance whether an opportunity for murder existed . She would have been taking more than a fair risk of being seen and recognized during her travels . If she avoided the train and hired a buggy , the stableman might have recognized her . If police had checked on her more thoroughly than is indicated , she would be completely eliminated as a suspect . Uncle John Vinnicum Morse was the immediate popular suspect . His sudden unannounced appearance at the Borden home was strange in that he did not carry an iota of baggage with him , although he clearly intended to stay overnight , if not longer . Lizzie stated during the inquest that while her father and uncle were in the sitting room the afternoon before the murders , she had been disturbed by their voices and had closed her door , even though it was a very hot day . It is evident that Lizzie did not tell everything she overheard between her father and her Uncle Morse . At that time Jennings had a young law associate named Arthur S. Phillips . A few years ago , not too long before his death , Phillips revealed in a newspaper story that he had always suspected Morse of the murders . He said Morse and Borden had quarreled violently in the house that day , information which must have come from Lizzie . It was obviously the sound of this argument that caused Lizzie to close her door . The New Bedford Standard-Times has reported Knowlton as saying , long after the trial , that if he only knew what Borden said during his conversation with Morse , he would have convicted `` somebody '' . Notice , Knowlton did not say that he would have obtained a conviction in the trial of Lizzie Borden . He said he would have convicted `` somebody '' . It is known that Morse did associate with a group of itinerant horse traders who made their headquarters at Westport , a town not far from Fall River . They were a vagabond lot and considered to be shady and undesirable characters . Fall River police did go to Westport to see if they could get any information against Morse and possibly find an accomplice whom he might have hired from among these men . These officers found no incriminating information . Morse's alibi was not as solid as it seemed . He said he returned from the visit to his niece on the 11:20 streetcar . The woman in the house where the niece was staying backed up his story and said she left when he did to shop for her dinner . Fall River is not a fashionable town . The dinner hour there was twelve noon . If this woman had delayed until after 11:20 to start her shopping , she would have had little time in which to prepare the substantial meal that was eaten at dinner in those days . It is possible that Morse told the woman it was 11:20 , but it could have been earlier , since she did serve dinner on time . Police did make an attempt to check on Morse's alibi . They interviewed the conductor of the streetcar Morse said he had taken , but the man did not remember Morse as a passenger . Questioned further , Morse said that there had been four or five priests riding on the same car with him . The conductor did recall having priests as passengers and this satisfied police , although the conductor also pointed out that in heavily Catholic Fall River there were priests riding on almost every trip the streetcar made , so Morse's statement really proved nothing . We do know that Morse left the house before nine o'clock . Bridget testified she saw him leave through the side door . Morse said Borden let him out and locked the screen door . From that point on he said he went to the post office and then walked leisurely to where his niece was staying , more than a mile away . He met nobody he knew on this walk . There is no accounting of his movements in this long gap of time which covers the early hours when Mrs. Borden was killed . Morse testified that while he was having breakfast in the dining room , Mrs. Borden told the servant , `` Bridget , I want you to wash these windows today '' . Bridget's testimony was in direct contradiction . She said it was after she returned from her vomiting spell in the back yard that Mrs. Borden told her to wash the windows . This was long after Morse had left the house . Morse's knowledge of what Mrs. Borden told Bridget could indicate that he had returned secretly to the house and was hidden there . He knew the house fairly well , he had been there on two previous visits during the past three or four months alone . And despite Knowlton's attempts to show that the house was locked up tighter than a drum , this was not true . The screen door was unlocked for some ten or fifteen minutes while Bridget was sick in the back . It was unlocked all the time she was washing windows . Morse could have returned openly while Bridget was sick in the back yard and gone up to the room he had occupied . Mrs. Borden would not have been alarmed if she saw Morse with an ax or hatchet in his hand . He had been to the farm the previous day and he could have said they needed the ax or hatchet at the farm . Mrs. Borden would have had no reason to disbelieve him and he could have approached close enough to her to swing before she could cry out . He could have left for Weybosset Street after her murder and made it in plenty of time by using the streetcar . If he took an earlier streetcar than the 11:20 on his return , he could have arrived at the Borden house shortly after Mr. Borden came home . With Lizzie in the barn , the screen door unlocked and Bridget upstairs in her attic room , he would have had free and easy access to the house . With the second murder over , he could have left , hidden the weapon in some vacant lot or an abandoned cistern in the neighborhood . His unconcerned stroll down the side of the house to a pear tree , with crowds already gathering in front of the building and Sawyer guarding the side door , was odd . There was no close examination of his clothes for bloodstains , and certainly no scientific test was made of them . And for a man who traveled around without any change of clothing , a few more stains on his dark suit may very well have gone unnoticed . The motive may have been the mysterious quarrel ; ; there was no financial gain for Morse in the murders . On the other side of the ledger is the fact that he did see his niece and the woman with whom she was staying . The time would have been shortly after the murder of Mrs. Borden and they noticed nothing unusual in his behavior . He said he had promised Mrs. Borden to return in time for dinner and that was close to the time when he did turn up at the Borden house . What did Pearson say about Bridget Sullivan as a possible suspect in his trial-book essay ? He wrote : `` The police soon ceased to look upon either Bridget or Mr. Morse as in possession of guilty knowledge . Neither had any interest in the deaths ; ; indeed , it was probably to Mr. Morse's advantage to have Mr. and Mrs. Borden alive . Both he and Bridget were exonerated by Lizzie herself '' . That was his complete discussion of Bridget Sullivan as a possible suspect . Although Pearson disbelieved almost everything Lizzie said , and read a sinister purpose into almost everything she did , he happily accepted her statement about Bridget as the whole truth . He felt nothing further need be said about the servant girl . The exoneration Pearson speaks of is not an exoneration , but Lizzie's expression of her opinion , as reported in the testimony of Assistant Marshal Fleet . This officer had asked Lizzie if she suspected her Uncle Morse , and she replied she didn't think he did it because he left the house before the murders and returned after them . Fleet asked the same question about Bridget , and Lizzie pointed out that as far as she knew Bridget had gone up to her room before her father's murder and came down when she called her . Lizzie , actually , never named any suspect . She told police about the prospective tenant she had heard quarreling with her father some weeks before the murders , but she said she thought he was from out of town because she heard him mention something about talking to his partner . And , much as she detested Hiram Harrington , she also did not accuse him . At the inquest she was asked specifically whether she knew anybody her father had bad feelings toward , or who had bad feelings toward her father . She replied , `` I know of one man that has not been friendly with him . They have not been friendly for years '' . Asked who this was , she named Harrington . Her statement certainly was true ; ; the press reported the same facts in using Harrington's interview , but Lizzie did not suggest at the inquest that Harrington was the killer . When I interviewed Kirby , who as a boy picked up pears in the Borden yard , I asked if anybody else in the household besides Lizzie and Morse had been under any suspicion at the time of the murders . He said he had not heard of anybody else . `` How about Bridget Sullivan '' ? I inquired . `` Oh , she was just the maid there '' , he replied , waving a hand to indicate how completely unimportant she was . Kirby was , of course , reflecting the opinion that existed at the time of murders . Everyone somehow manages to overlook completely the fact that , as far as we know , there were exactly two people in and about the house at the time of both murders : Lizzie Borden and Bridget Sullivan . All the officials on the case seem to have been afflicted with a similar myopia as far as Bridget was concerned , although records in police files contain many reports of servants who have murdered their employers . True , it is no longer cricket for the butler to be the killer in mystery fiction , but we are dealing here with actual people in real life and not imaginary characters and situations . The actions of Bridget should be examined , since she was there and opportunity did exist , if only to establish her innocence . There are also other factors that require closer examination . The legend as it exists in Fall River today always includes the solemn assurance that Bridget returned to Ireland after the trial with a `` big bundle '' of cash which Lizzie gave her for keeping her mouth shut . The people who believe and retell the legend have apparently never troubled to read the trial testimony and do not know that the maid changed her testimony on several key points , always to the detriment of Lizzie . If Bridget did get any bundles of cash , the last person who would have rewarded her for services rendered would have been Lizzie Borden . Bridget was born in Ireland , one of fourteen children . She was apparently the pioneer in her family because she had no close relatives in this country at that time . She worked as a domestic , first in Newport for a year , and then in South Bethlehem , Pennsylvania , for another year . She finally settled in Fall River and , after being employed for a time by a Mrs. Reed , was hired by the Bordens . I have previously described how , during the week of the murder , Bridget spent the first few hot days scrubbing and ironing clothes . Her father , James Upton , was the Upton mentioned by Hawthorne in the famous introduction to the Scarlet Letter as one of those who came into the old custom house to do business with him as the surveyor of the port . A gentleman of the old school , Mr. Upton possessed intellectual power , ample means , and withal , was a devoted Christian . The daughter profited from his interest in scientific and philosophical subjects . Her mother also was a person of superior mind and broad interests . There is clear evidence that Lucy from childhood had an unusual mind . She possessed an observant eye , a retentive memory , and a critical faculty . When she was nine years old , she wrote a description of a store she had visited . She named 48 items , and said there were `` many more things which it would take too long to write '' . An essay on `` Freedom '' written at 10 years of age quoted the Declaration of Independence , the freedom given to slaves in Canada , and the views of George Washington . Lucy Upton was graduated from the Salem High School when few colleges , only Oberlin and Elmira , were open to women ; ; and she had an appetite for learning that could not be denied . A picture of her in high school comes from a younger schoolmate , Albert S. Flint , friend of her brother Winslow , and later , like Winslow , a noted astronomer . He recalled Lucy , as `` a bright-looking black-eyed young lady who came regularly through the boys' study hall to join the class in Greek in the little recitation room beyond '' . The study of Greek was the distinctive mark of boys destined to go to college , and Lucy Upton too expected to go to college and take the full classical course offered to men . The death of her mother in 1865 prevented this . With four younger children at home , Lucy stepped into her mother's role , and even after the brothers and sisters were grown , she was her father's comfort and stay until he died in 1879 . But even so Lucy could not give up her intellectual pursuits . When her brother Winslow became a student at Brown University in 1874 , she wrote him about a course in history he was taking under Professor Diman : `` What is Prof. Diman's definition of civilization , and take the world through , is its progress ever onward , or does it retrograde at times ? Do you think I might profitably study some of the history you do , perhaps two weeks behind you . '' And that she proceeded to do . Many years later ( on August 3 , 1915 ) , Lucy Upton wrote Winslow's daughter soon to be graduated from Smith College : `` While I love botany which , after dabbling in for years , I studied according to the methods of that day exactly forty years ago in a summer school , it must be fascinating to take up zoology in the way you are doing . Whatever was the science in the high school course for the time being , that was my favorite study . Mathematics came next '' . Her study of history was persistently pursued . She read Maitland's Dark Ages , `` which I enjoyed very much '' ; ; La Croix on the Customs of the Middle Ages , 16 chapters of Bryce `` and liked it more and more '' ; ; more chapters of Guizot ; ; Lecky and Stanley's Eastern Church . She discussed in her letters to Winslow some of the questions that came to her as she studied alone . Lucy's correspondence with brother Winslow during his college days was not entirely taken up with academic studies . She played chess with him by postcard . Also Lucy and Winslow had a private contest to see which one could make the most words from the letters in `` importunately '' . Who won is not revealed , but Winslow's daughter Eleanor says they got up to 1,212 words . There was another family interest also . Winslow had musical talents , as had his father before him . At different times he served as glee-club and choir leader and as organist . And it was Lucy Upton who first started the idea of a regular course in Music at Spelman College . Winslow Upton after graduation from Brown University and two years of graduate study , accepted a position at the Harvard Observatory . For three years he was connected with the U.S. Naval Observatory and with the U.S. Signal Corps ; ; and after 1883 , was professor of astronomy at Brown University . The six expeditions to study eclipses of the sun , of which he was a member , took him to Colorado , Virginia , and California as well as to the South Pacific and to Russia . After her father's death , Lucy and her youngest sister lived for a few years with Winslow in Washington , D.C. . `` Their house '' , writes Albert S. Flint , `` was always a haven of hospitality and good cheer , especially grateful to one like myself far from home '' . Lucy was a lively part of the household . Moreover , she had physical as well as mental vigor . Winslow , as his daughters Eleanor and Margaret recall , used to characterize her as `` our iron sister '' . There is reason to suppose that Lucy would have made a record as publicly distinguished as her brother had it not been that her mother's death occurred just as she was about to enter college . As a matter of fact , Albert S. Flint expressed his conviction that `` her physical strength , her mental power , her lively interest in all objects about her and her readiness to serve her fellow beings '' would have led her `` to a distinguished career amongst the noted women of this country '' . While in Washington , D.C. , Lucy Upton held positions in the U.S. Census Office , and in the Pension Bureau . They were not sufficiently challenging however , and she resigned in 1887 , to go to Germany with her brother Winslow and his family while he was there on study . After the months in Europe , she returned to Boston and became active in church and community life . What was called an `` accidental meeting '' with Miss Packard in Washington turned her attention to Spelman . Here was a cause she believed in . After correspondence with Miss Packard and to the joy of Miss Packard and Miss Giles , she came to Atlanta , in the fall of 1888 , to help wherever needed , although there was then no money available to pay her a salary . She served for a number of years without pay beyond her travel and maintenance . Her students have spoken of the exacting standards of scholarship and of manners and conduct she expected and achieved from the students ; ; of her `` great power of discernment '' ; ; of `` her exquisiteness of dress '' , `` her well-modulated voice that went straight to the hearts of the hearers '' ; ; her great love of flowers and plants and birds ; ; and her close knowledge of individual students . She drew on all her resources of mind and heart to help them -- to make them at home in the world ; ; and as graduates gratefully recall , she drew on her purse as well . Many a student was able to remain at Spelman , only because of her unobtrusive help . Under Miss Upton , the work of the year 1909-10 went forward without interruption . After all , she had come to Spelman Seminary in 1888 , and had been since 1891 except for one year , Associate Principal or Dean . She had taught classes in botany , astronomy ( with the aid of a telescope ) , geometry , and psychology . Miss Upton and Miss Packard , as a matter of fact , had many tastes in common . Both had eager and inquiring minds ; ; and both believed that intellectual growth must go hand in hand with the development of sturdy character and Christian zeal . Both loved the out-of-doors , including mountain climbing and horseback riding . In 1890 when the trip to Europe and the Holy Land was arranged for Miss Packard , it was Miss Upton who planned the trip , and `` with rare executive ability '' bore the brunt of `` the entire pilgrimage from beginning to end '' . So strenuous it was physically , with its days of horseback riding over rough roads that it seems an amazing feat of endurance for both Miss Packard and Miss Upton . Yet they thrived on it . At the Fifteenth Anniversary ( 1896 ) as already quoted , Miss Upton projected with force and eloquence the Spelman of the Future as a college of first rank , with expanding and unlimited horizons . When Dr. Wallace Buttrick , wise in his judgment of people , declined to have the Science Building named for him , he wrote Miss Tapley ( April 7 , 1923 ) `` If you had asked me , I think I would have suggested that you name the building for Miss Upton . Her services to the School for many years were of a very high character , and I have often thought that one of the buildings should be named for her '' . Such were the qualities of the Acting-President of the Seminary after the death of Miss Giles . At the meeting of the Board of Trustees , on March 3 , 1910 , Miss Upton presented the annual report of the President . She noted that no student had been withdrawn through loss of confidence ; ; that the enrollment showed an increase of boarding students as was desired ; ; and that the year's work had gone forward smoothly . She urged the importance of more thorough preparation for admission . The raising of the $25,000 Improvement Fund two days before the time limit expired , and the spontaneous `` praise demonstration '' held afterward on the campus , were reported as events which had brought happiness to Miss Giles . With the Fund in hand , the debt on the boilers had been paid ; ; Rockefeller and Packard Halls had been renovated ; ; walks laid ; ; and ground had been broken for the superintendent's home . Miss Upton spoke gratefully of the response of Spelman graduates and Negro friends in helping to raise the Fund , and their continuing efforts to raise money for greatly needed current expenses . She spoke also with deep thankfulness of the many individuals and agencies whose interest and efforts through the years had made the work so fruitful in results . Two bequests were recorded : one of $200 under the will of Mrs. Harriet A. Copp of Los Angeles ; ; and one of $2,000 under the will of Miss Celia L. Brett of Hamilton , New York , a friend from the early days . Miss Upton told the Trustees that the death of Miss Giles was `` the sorest grief '' the Seminary had ever been called upon to bear . The daughters of Spelman , she said , had never known or thought of Spelman without her . The removal of Miss Packard 18 years earlier had caused them great sorrow , but they still had Miss Giles . Now the school was indeed bereft . `` Yet Spelman has strong , deep roots , and will live for the blessing of generations to come '' . Miss Mary Jane Packard , Sophia's half-sister , became ill in March , 1910 ; ; and when school closed , she was unable to travel to Massachusetts . She remained in Atlanta through June and July ; ; she died on August sixth . Before coming on a visit to Spelman in 1885 , Miss Mary had been a successful teacher in Worcester , and her position there was held open for her for a considerable period . But she decided to stay at Spelman . She helped with teaching as well as office work for a few years -- the catalogues show that she had classes in geography , rhetoric and bookkeeping . Soon the office work claimed all her time . She was closely associated with the Founders in all their trials and hardships . Quiet and energetic , cheerful and calm , she too was a power in the development of the seminary . Miss Giles always used to refer to her as `` Sister '' . She served as secretary in the Seminary office for 25 years , and was in charge of correspondence , records , and bookkeeping . The books of the school hold a memorial to her ; ; and so do the hearts of students and of teachers . Mary J. Packard , states a Messenger editorial , was `` efficient , pains-taking , self-effacing , loving , radiating the spirit of her Master . With infinite patience she responded to every call , no matter at what cost to herself , and to her all went , for she was sure to have the needed information or word of cheer . In a few school districts one finds a link between school and job . In those vocational programs organized with Smith-Hughes money , there may be a close tie between the labor union and a local employer on the one hand and the vocational teacher on the other . In these cases a graduate may enter directly into an apprentice program , saving a year because of his vocational courses in grades 11 and 12 . The apprentice program will involve further education on a part-time basis , usually at night , perhaps using some of the same equipment of the high school . These opportunities are to be found in certain cities in such crafts as auto mechanics , carpentry , drafting , electrical work , tool-and-die work , and sheet-metal work . Formally organized vocational programs supported by federal funds allow high school students to gain experience in a field of work which is likely to lead to a full-time job on graduation . The `` diversified occupations '' program is a part-time trade-preparatory program conducted over two school years on a cooperative basis between the school and local industrial and business employers . The `` distributive education '' program operates in a similar way , with arrangements between the school and employers in merchandising fields . In both cases the student attends school half-time and works in a regular job the other half . He receives remuneration for his work . In a few places cooperative programs between schools and employers in clerical work have shown the same possibilities for allowing the student , while still in school , to develop skills which are immediately marketable upon graduation . Adult education courses , work-study programs of various sorts -- these are all evidence of a continuing interest of the schools in furthering educational opportunities for out-of-school youth . In general , however , it may be said that when a boy or a girl leaves the high school , the school authorities play little or no part in the decision of what happens next . If the student drops out of high school , the break with the school is even more complete . When there is employment opportunity for youth , this arrangement -- or lack of arrangement -- works out quite well . Indeed , in some periods of our history and in some neighborhoods the job opportunities have been so good that undoubtedly a great many boys who were potential members of the professions quit school at an early age and went to work . Statistically this has represented a loss to the nation , although one must admit that in an individual case the decision in retrospect may have been a wise one . I make no attempt to measure the enduring satisfaction and material well-being of a man who went to work on graduation from high school and was highly successful in the business which he entered . He may or may not be `` better off '' than his classmate who went on to a college and professional school . But in the next decades the nation needs to educate for the professions all the potential professional talent . In a later chapter dealing with the suburban school , I shall discuss the importance of arranging a program for the academically talented and highly gifted youth in any high school where he is found . In the Negro neighborhoods and also to some extent in the mixed neighborhoods the problem may be one of identification and motivation . High motivation towards higher education must start early enough so that by the time the boy or girl reaches grade 9 he or she has at least developed those basic skills which are essential for academic work . Undoubtedly far more can be done in the lower grades in this regard in the Negro schools . However , the teacher can only go so far if the attitude of the community and the family is anti-intellectual . And the fact remains that there are today few shining examples of Negroes in positions of intellectual leadership . This is not due to any policy of discrimination on the part of the Northern universities . Quite the contrary , as I can testify from personal experience as a former university president . Rather we see here another vicious circle . The absence of successful Negroes in the world of scholarship and science has tended to tamp down enthusiasm among Negro youth for academic careers . I believe the situation is improving , but the success stories need to be heavily publicized . Here again we run into the roadblock that Negroes do not like to be designated as Negroes in the press . How can the vicious circle be broken ? This is a problem to which leaders of opinion , both Negro and white , should devote far more attention . It is at least as important as the more dramatic attempts to break down barriers of inequality in the South . Vocational education I should like to underline four points I made in my first report with respect to vocational education . First and foremost , vocational courses should not replace courses which are essential parts of the required academic program for graduation . Second , vocational courses should be provided in grades 11 and 12 and not require more than half the student's time in those years ; ; however , for slow learners and prospective dropouts these courses ought to begin earlier . Third , the significance of the vocational courses is that those enrolled are keenly interested in the work ; ; they realize the relevance of what they are learning to their future careers , and this sense of purpose is carried over to the academic courses which they are studying at the same time . Fourth , the type of vocational training programs should be related to the employment opportunities in the general locality . This last point is important because if high school pupils are aware that few , if any , graduates who have chosen a certain vocational program have obtained a job as a consequence of the training , the whole idea of relevance disappears . Vocational training which holds no hope that the skill developed will be in fact a marketable skill becomes just another school `` chore '' for those whose interest in their studies has begun to falter . Those who , because of population mobility and the reputed desire of employers to train their own employees , would limit vocational education to general rather than specific skills ought to bear in mind the importance of motivation in any kind of school experience . I have been using the word `` vocational '' as a layman would at first sight think it should be used . I intend to include under the term all the practical courses open to boys and girls . These courses develop skills other than those we think of when we use the adjective `` academic '' . Practically all of these practical skills are of such a nature that a degree of mastery can be obtained in high school sufficient to enable the youth to get a job at once on the basis of the skill . They are in this sense skills marketable immediately on graduation from high school . To be sure , in tool-and-die work and in the building trades , the first job must be often on an apprentice basis , but two years of half-time vocational training enables the young man thus to anticipate one year of apprentice status . Similarly , a girl who graduates with a good working knowledge of stenography and the use of clerical machines and who is able to get a job at once may wish to improve her skill and knowledge by a year or two of further study in a community college or secretarial school . Of course , it can be argued that an ability to write English correctly and with some degree of elegance is a marketable skill . So , too , is the mathematical competence of a college graduate who has majored in mathematics . In a sense almost all high school and college courses could be considered as vocational to the extent that later in life the student in his vocation ( which may be a profession ) will be called upon to use some of the skills developed and the competence obtained . In spite of the shading of one type of course into another , I believe it is useful to talk about vocational courses as apart from academic courses . Perhaps a course in typewriting might be regarded as the exception which proves the rule . Today many college bound students try to take a course in personal typing , as they feel a certain degree of mastery of this skill is almost essential for one who proposes to do academic work in college and a professional school . Most of our largest cities have one or more separate vocational or technical high schools . In this respect , public education in the large cities differs from education in the smaller cities and consolidated school districts . The neighborhood high schools are not , strictly speaking , comprehensive schools , because some of the boys and girls may be attending a vocational or technical high school instead of the local school . Indeed , one school superintendent in a large city objects to the use of the term comprehensive high school for the senior high schools in his city , because these schools do not offer strictly vocational programs . He prefers to designate such schools as `` general '' high schools . The suburban high school , it is worth noting , also is not a widely comprehensive high school because of the absence of vocational programs . The reason is that there is a lack of interest on the part of the community . Therefore employment and education in all the schools in a metropolitan area are related in different ways from those which are characteristic of the comprehensive high school described in my first report . The separate vocational or technical high schools in the large cities must be reckoned as permanent institutions . By and large their programs are satisfactorily connected both to the employment situation and to the realities of the apprentice system . It is not often realized to what degree certain trades are in many communities closed areas of employment , except for a lucky few . One has to talk confidentially with some of the directors of vocational high schools to realize that a boy cannot just say , `` I want to be a plumber '' , and then , by doing good work , find a job . It is far more difficult in many communities to obtain admission to an apprentice program which involves union approval than to get into the most selective medical school in the nation . Two stories will illustrate what I have in mind . One vocational instructor in a city vocational school , speaking of his course in a certain field , said he had no difficulty placing all students in jobs outside of the city . In the city , he said , the waiting list for those who want to join the union is so long that unless a boy has an inside track he can't get in . In a far distant part of the United States , I was talking to an instructor about a boy who in the twelfth grade was doing special work . `` What does he have in mind to do when he graduates '' ? `` Oh , he'll be a plumber '' , came the answer . `` But isn't it almost impossible to get into the union '' ? I asked . `` He'll have no difficulty '' , I was told . `` He has very good connections '' . In my view , there should be a school which offers significant vocational programs for boys within easy reach of every family in a city . Ideally these schools should be so located that one or more should be in the area where demand for practical courses is at the highest . An excellent example of a successful location of a new vocational high school is the Dunbar Vocational High School in Chicago . Located in a bad slum area now undergoing redevelopment , this school and its program are especially tailored to the vocational aims of its students . Hardly a window has been broken since Dunbar first was opened ( and vandalism in schools is a major problem in many slum areas ) . I discovered in the course of a visit there that almost all the pupils were Negroes . They were learning trades as diverse as shoe repairing , bricklaying , carpentry , cabinet making , auto mechanics , and airplane mechanics . The physical facilities at Dunbar are impressive , but more impressive is the attitude of the pupils . The soybean seed is the most important leguminous food in the world . In the United States , where half of the world crop is grown , soybeans are processed for their edible oil . The residue from soybean processing goes mainly into animal feeds . Soybeans are extensively processed into a remarkable number of food products in the Orient . American chemists , seeking to increase exports of soybeans , have adapted modern techniques and fermentation methods to improve their use in such traditional Japanese foods as tofu and miso and in tempeh of Indonesia . Soybean flour , grits , flakes , `` milk '' , and curd can be bought in the United States . Peanuts are the world's second most important legume . They are used mainly for their oil . We produce peanut oil , but to a much greater extent we eat the entire seed . Blanched peanuts , as prepared for making peanut butter or for eating as nuts , are roasted seeds whose seedcoats have been rubbed off . Cereal grains , supplemented with soybeans or dry edible peas or beans , comprise about two-thirds or three-fourths of the diet in parts of Asia and Africa . In western Europe and North America , where the level of economic development is higher , grains and other seed products furnish less than one-third of the food consumed . Rather , meat and potatoes , sugar , and dairy products are the main sources of carbohydrate , protein , oils , and fats . People depend less on seeds for foods in Australia , New Zealand , and Argentina , where extensive grazing lands support sheep or cattle , and the consumption of meat is high . Feeds for livestock took about one-sixth of the world's cereal crop in 1957-1958 . Most of the grain is fed to swine and dairy cows and lesser amounts to beef cattle and poultry . About 90 percent of the corn used in the United States is fed to animals . The rest is used for human food and industrial products . More than half of the sorghum and barley seeds we produce and most of the byproducts of the milling of cereals and the crushing of oilseeds are fed to livestock . More than 200 million tons of seeds and seed products are fed to livestock annually in the United States . The efficiency with which animals convert grains and forages to meat has risen steadily in the United States since the 1930's and has paralleled the increased feeding of the cake and meal that are a byproduct when seeds are processed for oil . The demand for food is so great in the world that little arable land can be given over to growing the nonfood crops . Seeds grown for industrial uses hold a relatively minor position . Chief among the seed crops grown primarily for industrial uses are the oil-bearing seeds -- flax , castor , tung ( nuts from the China wood-oil tree ) , perilla ( from an Oriental mint ) , and oiticica ( from a Brazilian tree ) . Oils , or liquid fats , from the seeds of flax and tung have long been the principal constituents of paints and varnishes for protecting and beautifying the surfaces of wood and metal . These oils develop hard , smooth films when they dry and form resinlike substances . The artist who paints in oil uses drying oils to carry the pigments and to protect his finished work for the ages . One of the finest of artists' oils comes from poppy seeds . Seeds of soybean , cotton , corn , sesame , and rape yield semidrying oils . Some are used in paints along with drying oils . Palm oil protects the surfaces of steel sheets before they are plated with tin . Castor oil , made from castorbeans , has gone out of style as a medicine . This nondrying oil , however , is now more in demand than ever before as a fine lubricant , as a constituent of fluids for hydraulically operated equipment , and as a source of chemicals to make plastics . Almond oil , another nondrying oil , was once used extensively in perfumery to extract flower fragrances . It is still used in drugs and cosmetics , but it is rather scarce and sometimes is adulterated with oils from peach and plum seeds . Liquid fats from all these oilseeds enter into the manufacture of soaps for industry and the household and of glycerin for such industrial uses as making explosives . Sizable amounts of soybean , coconut , and palm kernel oil -- seed oils that are produced primarily for food purposes -- also are used to make soaps , detergents , and paint resins . Solid fats from the seeds of the mahua tree , the shea tree , and the coconut palm are used to make candles in tropical countries . Seeds are a main source of starch for industrial and food use in many parts of the world . Corn and wheat supply most of the starch in the United States , Canada , and Australia . In other countries where cereal grains are not among the principal crops of a region , starchy tubers or roots are processed for starch . Starch is used in the paper , textile , and food-processing industries and in a multitude of other manufacturing operations . Gums were extracted from quince , psyllium ( fleawort ) , flax , and locust ( carob ) seeds in ancient times . Today the yearly import into the United States of locust bean gum is more than 15 million pounds ; ; of psyllium seed , more than 2.6 million . The discovery during the Second World War that guar gum was similar to imported locust gum increased its cultivation in western Asia and initiated it in the United States . Water-soluble gums are used in foods and drugs and in the manufacture of pulp and paper as thickeners , stabilizers , or dispersing agents . Guar gum thickens salad dressings and stabilizes ice cream . Quince seed gum is the main ingredient in wave-setting lotions . Once regarded as an agricultural nuisance , psyllium was sold in the 1930's as a mechanical laxative under 117 different brands . Locust gum is added to pulp slurries to break up the lumps of fibers in making paper . The seeds of hard , fibrous , stony fruits , called nuts , provide highly concentrated foods , oils , and other materials of value . Most nuts consist of the richly packaged storage kernel and its thick , adherent , brown covering -- the seedcoat . The kernels of brazil nuts , cashews , coconuts , filberts , hazelnuts , hickory nuts , pecans , walnuts , and pine nuts are predominantly oily . Almonds and pistachio nuts are not so high in oil but are rich in protein . Chestnuts are starchy . All nut kernels are rich in protein . The world production of familiar seed nuts -- almonds , brazil nuts , filberts , and the English walnuts -- totals about 300 thousand tons annually . Coconuts , the fruit of the coconut palm , have the largest of all known seeds and are grown in South Pacific islands as a crop for domestic and export markets . The oil palm of West Africa yields edible oil from both the flesh and the seed or kernel of its fruit . World production of copra , the oil-bearing flesh of the coconut , was a little more than 3 million tons in 1959 . Exports from producing countries in terms of equivalent oil were a little more than 1 million tons , about half of which was palm kernels or oil from them and about half was palm oil . Other nuts consumed in lesser quantity include the spicy nutmeg ; ; the soap nut , which owes its sudsing power to natural saponins ; ; the marking nut , used for ink and varnish ; ; the aromatic sassafras nut of South America ; ; and the sweet-smelling cumara nut , which is suited for perfumes . A forest crop that has not been extensively cultivated is ivory nuts from the tagua palm . The so-called vegetable ivory is the hard endosperm of the egg-sized seed . It is used for making buttons and other small , hard objects of turnery . Seeds of the sago palm are used in Bermuda to make heads and faces of dolls sold to tourists . The color and shape of seeds have long made them attractive for ornaments and decorations . Since Biblical times , rosaries have been made from jobs-tears -- the seeds of an Asiatic grass . Bead tree seeds are the necklaces of South Pacific islanders and the eyes of Buddha dolls in Cuba . Victorian ladies had a fad of stringing unusual seeds to wear as jewelry . Handmade Christmas wreaths and trees often contain a variety of seeds collected during the year . Tradition has assigned medicinal values to seeds because of their alkaloids , aromatic oils , and highly flavored components . Although science has given us more effective materials , preparations from anise , castorbean , colchicum , nux vomica , mustard , fennel , and stramonium are familiar to many for the relief of human ailments . Flaxseed poultices and mustard plasters still are used by some persons . Peanut and sesame oils often are used as carriers or diluents for medicines administered by injection . Still another group of seeds ( sometimes tiny , dry , seed-bearing fruits ) provide distinctive flavors and odors to foods , although the nutrients they supply are quite negligible . The common spices , flavorings , and condiments make up this group . Each year millions of pounds of anise , caraway , mustard , celery , and coriander and the oils extracted from them are imported . Single-seeded dry fruits used for flavoring include several of the carrot family , such as cumin , dill , fennel , and angelica . Less common seeds used in cooking and beverages include fenugreek ( artificial maple flavor ) and cardamom . White pepper is the ground seed of the common black pepper fruit . Sesame seed , which comes from the tall pods of a plant grown in Egypt , Brazil , and Central America , has a toasted-nut flavor and can be used in almost any dish calling for almonds . It is a main flavoring for halvah , the candy of the Middle East . Sesame sticks , a snack dip , originated in the Southwest . Beverages are made from seeds the world over . Coffee is made from the roasted and ground seeds of the coffee tree . World production of coffee broke all previous records in 1959 and 1960 at more than 5 million tons . Per capita consumption remains around 16 pounds in the United States . Cocoa , chocolate , and cocoa butter come from the ground seeds of the cacao tree . World production of about 1 million tons is divided primarily between Africa ( 63 percent ) and South America ( 27 percent ) . Several soft drinks contain extracts from kola nuts , the seed of the kola tree cultivated in the West Indies and South America . Cereal grains have been used for centuries to prepare fermented beverages . The Japanese sake is wine fermented from rice grain . Arrack is distilled from fermented rice in India . Beer , generally fermented from barley , is an old alcoholic beverage . Beer was brewed by the Babylonians and Egyptians more than 6 thousand years ago . Brewers today use corn , rice , and malted barley . Distillers use corn , malt , wheat , grain sorghum , and rye in making beverage alcohol . Seed crops hold a prominent place in the agricultural economy of the United States . The farm value of seeds produced in this country for all purposes , including the cereals , is nearly 10 billion dollars a year . Cereal grains , oilseeds , and dry beans and peas account for about 57 percent of the farm value of all crops raised . The economic importance of seed crops actually is even greater , because additional returns are obtained from most of the corn , oats , barley , and sorghum -- as well as the cake and meal from the processing of flaxseed , cottonseed , and soybeans -- through conversion to poultry , meat , and dairy products . Seeds furnish about 40 percent of the total nutrients consumed by all livestock . Hay and pasture are the other chief sources of livestock feed . Seeds are the essential raw materials for milling grain , baking , crushing oilseed , refining edible oil , brewing , distilling , and mixing feed . More than 11 thousand business establishments in the United States were based on cereals and oilseeds in 1954 . The value of products from these industries was 15.8 billion dollars , of which about one-third was created by manufacturing processes . Not included was the value of seed oil in paints and varnishes or the value of the coffee and chocolate industries that are based on imported seed or seed products . Cereal grains furnish about one-fourth of the total food calories in the American diet and about one-third of the total nutrients consumed by all livestock and poultry . To hold a herd of cattle on a new range till they felt at home was called `` locatin' '' 'em . To keep 'em scattered somewhat and yet herd 'em was called `` loose herdin' '' . To hold 'em in a compact mass was `` close herdin' '' . Cattle were inclined to remain in a territory with which they were acquainted . That became their `` home range '' . Yet there were always some that moved farther and farther out , seekin' grass and water . These became `` strays '' , the term bein' restricted to cattle , however , as hosses , under like circumstances , were spoken of as `` stray hosses '' , not merely `` strays '' . Cattle would drift day and night in a blizzard till it was over . You couldn't stop 'em ; ; you had to go with 'em or wait till the storm was over , and follow . Such marchin' in wholesale numbers was called a `` drift '' , or `` winter drift '' , and if the storm was prolonged it usually resulted in one of the tragedies of the range . The cowboy made a technical distinction in reference to the number of them animals . The single animal or a small bunch were referred to as `` strays '' ; ; but when a large number were `` bunched up '' or `` banded up '' , and marched away from their home range , as long as they stayed together the group was said to be a `` drift '' . Drifts usually occurred in winter in an effort to escape the severe cold winds , but it could also occur in summer as the result of lack of water or grass because of a drought , or as an aftermath of a stampede . Drifts usually happened only with cattle , for hosses had 'nough sense to avoid 'em , and to find shelter for 'emselves . The wholesale death of cattle as a result of blizzards , and sometimes droughts , over a wide range of territory was called a `` die-up '' . Followin' such an event there was usually a harvest of `` fallen hides '' , and the ranchers needed skinnin' knives instead of brandin' irons . Cattle were said to be `` potted '' when `` blizzard choked '' , that is , caught in a corner or a draw , or against a `` drift fence '' durin' a storm . Cattle which died from them winter storms were referred to as the `` winter kill '' . When cattle in winter stopped and humped their backs up they were said to `` bow up '' . This term was also used by the cowboy in the sense of a human showin' fight , as one cowhand was heard to say , `` He arches his back like a mule in a hailstorm '' . Cattle drove to the northern ranges and held for two winters to mature 'em into prime beef were said to be `` double wintered '' . Cattle brought into a range from a distance were called `` immigrants '' . Them new to the country were referred to as `` pilgrims '' . This word was first applied to the imported hot-blooded cattle , but later was more commonly used as reference to a human tenderfoot . Hereford cattle were often called `` white faces '' , or `` open-face cattle '' , and the old-time cowman gave the name of `` hothouse stock '' to them newly introduced cattle . Because Holstein cattle weren't a beef breed , they were rarely seen on a ranch , though one might be found now and then for the milk supply . The cowboy called this breed of cattle `` magpies '' . A `` cattaloe '' was a hybrid offspring of buffalo and cattle . `` Dry stock '' denoted , regardless of age or sex , such bovines as were givin' no milk . A `` wet herd '' was a herd of cattle made up entirely of cows , while `` wet stuff '' referred to cows givin' milk . The cowboy's humorous name for a cow givin' milk was a `` milk pitcher '' . Cows givin' no milk were knowed as `` strippers '' . The terminology of the range , in speakin' of `` dry stock '' and `` wet stock '' , was confusin' to the tenderfoot . The most common reference to `` wet stock '' was with the meanin' that such animals had been smuggled across the Rio Grande after bein' stolen from their rightful owners . The term soon became used and applied to all stolen animals . `` Mixed herd '' meant a herd of mixed sexes , while a `` straight steer herd '' was one composed entirely of steers , and when the cowman spoke of `` mixed cattle '' , he meant cattle of various grades , ages , and sexes . In the spring when penned cattle were turned out to grass , this was spoken of as `` turn-out time '' , or `` put to grass '' . `` Shootin' 'em out '' was gettin' cattle out of a corral onto the range . When a cow came out of a corral in a crouchin' run she was said to `` come out a-stoopin' '' . To stir cattle up and get 'em heated and excited was to `` mustard the cattle '' , and the act was called `` ginnin' 'em 'round '' , or `` chousin' 'em '' . After a roundup the pushin' of stray cattle of outside brands toward their home range was called `` throwin' over '' . A cow rose from the ground rear end first . By the time her hindquarters were in a standin' position , her knees were on the ground in a prayin' attitude . It was when she was in this position that the name `` prayin' cow '' was suggested to the cowboy . They were said to be `` on their heads '' when grazin' . `` On the hoof '' was a reference to live cattle and was also used in referrin' to cattle travelin' by trail under their own power as against goin' by rail . Shippin' cattle by train was called a `` stock run '' . A general classification given grass-fed cattle was `` grassers '' . When a cowboy spoke of `` dustin' '' a cow , he meant that he throwed dust into her eyes . The cow , unlike a bull or steer , kept her eyes open and her mind on her business when chargin' , and a cow `` on the prod '' or `` on the peck '' was feared by the cowhand more than any of his other charges . The Injun's name for beef was `` wohaw '' , and many of the old frontiersmen adopted it from their association with the Injun on the trails . The first cattle the Injuns saw under the white man's control were the ox teams of the early freighters . Listenin' with wonder at the strange words of the bullwhackers as they shouted `` Whoa '' , `` Haw '' , and `` Gee '' , they thought them words the names of the animals , and began callin' cattle `` wohaws '' . Rarely did a trail herd pass through the Injun country on its march north that it wasn't stopped to receive demand for `` wohaw '' . `` Tailin' '' was the throwin' of an animal by the tail in lieu of a rope . Any animal could when travelin' fast , be sent heels over head by the simple process of overtakin' the brute , seizin' its tail , and givin' the latter a pull to one side . This throwed the animal off balance , and over it'd crash onto its head and shoulders . Though the slightest yank was frequently capable of producin' results , many men assured success through a turn of the tail 'bout the saddle horn , supplemented sometimes , in the case of cattle , by a downward heave of the rider's leg upon the strainin' tail . Such tactics were resorted to frequently with the unmanageable longhorns , and a thorough `` tailin' '' usually knocked the breath out of a steer , and so dazed 'im that he'd behave for the rest of the day . It required both a quick and swift hoss and a darin' rider . When cattle became more valuable , ranch owners frowned upon this practice and it was discontinued , at least when the boss was 'round . When the cowboy used the word `` tailin's '' , he meant stragglers . `` Bull tailin' '' was a game once pop'lar with the Mexican cowboys of Texas . From a pen of wild bulls one would be released , and with much yellin' a cowhand'd take after 'im . Seizin' the bull by the tail , he rushed his hoss forward and a little to one side , throwin' the bull off balance , and `` bustin' '' 'im with terrific force . Rammin' one horn of a downed steer into the ground to hold 'im down was called `` peggin' '' . Colors of cattle came in for their special names . An animal covered with splotches or spots of different colors was called a `` brindle '' or `` brockle '' . A `` lineback '' was an animal with a stripe of different color from the rest of its body runnin' down its back , while a `` lobo stripe '' was the white , yeller , or brown stripe runnin' down the back , from neck to tail , a characteristic of many Spanish cattle . A `` mealynose '' was a cow or steer of the longhorn type , with lines and dots of a color lighter'n the rest of its body 'round the eyes , face , and nose . Such an animal was said to be `` mealynosed '' . `` Sabinas '' was a Spanish word used to describe cattle of red and white peppered and splotched colorin' . The northern cowboy called all the red Mexican cattle which went up the trail `` Sonora reds '' , while they called all cattle drove up from Mexico `` yaks '' , because they came from the Yaqui Injun country , or gave 'em the name of `` Mexican buckskins '' . Near the southern border , cattle of the early longhorn breed whose coloration was black with a lineback , with white speckles frequently appearin' on the sides and belly , were called `` zorrillas '' . This word was from the Spanish , meanin' `` polecat '' . `` Yeller bellies '' were cattle of Mexican breed splotched on flank and belly with yellerish color . An animal with distinct coloration , or other marks easily distinguished and remembered by the owner and his riders , was sometimes used as a `` marker '' . Such an animal has frequently been the downfall of the rustler . Countin' each grazin' bunch of cattle where it was found on the range and driftin' it back so that it didn't mix with the uncounted cattle was called a `` range count '' . The countin' of cattle in a pasture without throwin' 'em together for the purpose was called a `` pasture count '' . The counters rode through the pasture countin' each bunch of grazin' cattle , and drifted it back so that it didn't get mixed with the uncounted cattle ahead . This method of countin' was usually done at the request , and in the presence , of a representative of the bank that held the papers against the herd . Them notes and mortgages were spoken of as `` cattle paper '' . A `` book count '' was the sellin' of cattle by the books , commonly resorted to in the early days , sometimes much to the profit of the seller . This led to the famous sayin' in the Northwest of the `` books won't freeze '' . This became a common byword durin' the boom days when Eastern and foreign capital were so eager to buy cattle interests . The origin of this sayin' was credited to a saloonkeeper by the name of Luke Murrin . His saloon was a meetin' place for influential Wyoming cattlemen , and one year durin' a severe blizzard , when his herd-owner customers were wearin' long faces , he said , `` Cheer up , boys , whatever happens , the books won't freeze '' . In this carefree sentence he summed up the essence of the prevailin' custom of buyin' by book count , and created a sayin' which has survived through the years . `` Range delivery '' meant that the buyer , after examinin' the seller's ranch records and considerin' his rep'tation for truthfulness , paid for what the seller claimed to own , then rode out and tried to find it . When a cowhand said that a man had `` good cow sense '' , he meant to pay 'im a high compliment . No matter by what name cattle were called , there was no denyin' that they not only saved Texas from financial ruin , but went far toward redeemin' from a wilderness vast territories of the Northwest . 21 swingin' a wide loop the first use of the word `` rustler '' was as a synonym for `` hustler '' , becomin' an established term for any person who was active , pushin' , and bustlin' in any enterprise . Again it was used as the title for the hoss wrangler , and when the order was given to go out and `` rustle the hosses '' , it meant for 'im to go out and herd 'em in . Eventually herdin' the hosses was spoken of as `` hoss rustlin' '' , and the wrangler was called the `` hoss rustler '' . Later , the word became almost exclusively applied to a cow thief , startin' from the days of the maverick when cowhands were paid by their employers to `` get out and rustle a few mavericks '' . It was John who found the lion tracks . He found them near the carcass of a zebra that had been killed the night before , and he circled once , nose to the ground , hair shooting up along his back , as it did when he was after lion or bear , and then he lifted his head and bayed , and the pack joined in , all heads high , and Jones knew it was a hot trail . He stifled the Comanche yell and let John lead him straight toward the nearby black volcanic mountain . This mountain was known as The Black Reef and it rose almost perpendicularly for about two hundred feet , honeycombed with caves , top covered with dense scrub and creepers and tall grass . On the south it ended sharply as though the lava had been cut off there suddenly . Kearton and Ulyate had started the day together while Jones followed the dogs , and Means and Loveless had taken another route , and now , with the discovery of the fresh trail still unknown to him , Ulyate reined in , in the shadow of the Reef and pointed . Kearton focussed his field glasses . `` That's the Colonel '' , he said , `` But I can't see the dogs '' . As they watched , Jones rode straight for the Reef . Then they picked up the smaller black specks on the plain in front of him . The dogs were working a trail -- lion ? Hyena ? The pack had made a bend to the north , swinging back toward the Reef , and Kearton and Ulyate could hear them faintly . Kearton got off and tore up some dry grass that grew in cracks between the rocks and piled it in a heap and wanted to make the smoke signal that would bring Loveless and Means and the rest of the party . `` Not yet '' , cautioned Ulyate . Jones came toward them fast , now , along the southern toe of the Reef , and the dogs could be heard plainly , Old John with his Grand Canyon voice outstanding above the others . There was Sounder , too , also a veteran of the North Rim , and Rastus and the Rake from a pack of English fox-hounds , and a collie from a London pound , and Simba , a terrier . A motley pack , chosen for effectiveness , not beauty . Jones was galloping close behind them leaning down , cheering them on . `` Light it '' ! Ulyate said , and Kearton touched a match to the pile of grass , blew on it and flame licked out . He threw green stuff on it , and a thin blue column of smoke rose . `` That will fetch the gang and tell the Colonel where we are '' . Two quick shots sounded . Then there was a chorus of wild barking and baying . Then the heavy roar of a lion . Kearton and Ulyate looked at each other and began to gallop toward the sound . It came from the top of the Reef not half a mile away . At the base of the rocky hillside , they left their horses and climbed on foot . The route was choked with rugged lava-rocks , creepers and bushes , so thickly overgrown that when Kearton lost sight of Ulyate and called , Ulyate answered from ten feet away . Nice country to meet a lion in face to face . Ulyate and Kearton climbed on toward the sound of the barking of the dogs and the sporadic roaring of the lion , till they came , out of breath , to the crest , and peering through the branches of a bush , this is what Ulyate saw : Jones who had apparently ( and actually had ) ridden up the nearly impassable hillside , sitting calmly on his horse within forty feet of a full-grown young lioness , who was crouched on a flat rock and seemed just about to charge him , while the dogs whirled around her . Ulyate drew back with a start , and put finger to lips , almost afraid to move or whisper lest it set her off , `` The dogs have got her bayed . She's just the other side of that bush '' ! And when they had drawn back a step he added : `` Jones is sitting on his horse right in front of her . Why she doesn't charge him , I don't know . And he hasn't even got a knife on him . He couldn't get away from her in this kind of ground . Careful , don't disturb her '' . Jones had been about a hundred and fifty feet from her when he first broke through to the top of the Reef . She was standing on a flat rock three feet above ground and when she saw him she rose to full height and roared , opening her mouth wide , lashing her tail , and stamping at the rock with both forefeet in irritation , as much as to say : `` How dare you disturb me in my sacred precinct '' ? Intuition told him , however , that she was tired and winded from the run up the Reef and would not charge , yet . He moved forward to within thirty-five feet of her , being careful , because he knew the female is less predictable than the male . ( In the graveyard at Nairobi he had been shown the graves of thirty-four big game hunters killed hunting the animals he was attempting to lasso . Of the thirty-four , seventeen had been killed by lions , and eleven out of the seventeen by lionesses . ) She snarled terribly but intuition told him , again , that she was bluffing , and he could see that half her attention was distracted by the dogs . He threw the lasso . It was falling over her head when a branch of a bush caught it and it fell in front of her on the rock . Even then , if she took one step forward he could catch her . But John nipped her rear end -- one lion's rear end was as good as another to John , Africa , Arizona no matter -- and she changed ends and took a swipe at John , but he ducked back . Jones then recoiled his rope and threw again , this time hitting her on the back but failing to encircle her . She whirled and faced him , roaring terribly , and Ulyate , watching through the leaves , could not understand why she did not charge and obliterate him , because he wouldn't have much of a chance of getting away , in that thick growth , but she seemed just a trace uncertain ; ; while Jones , on the other hand , appeared perfectly confident and Ulyate decided perhaps that was the answer . From the lioness' point of view , this strange creature on the back of another creature , lashing out with its long thin paw , very likely appeared as something she could not at first cope with . But now she sank lower to the rock . Her roar changed to a growl . Her tail no longer lashed . Although she appeared more subdued and defeated , Jones knew she was growing more dangerous . She was rested and could mount a charge . Just the tip of her tail was moving as she crouched , and she was treading lightly up and down with her hind feet . At this moment , Loveless and Means arrived , crashing through the undergrowth with their horses , and distracted her , and she ran off a short distance and jumped into a crevice between two rocks . The dogs followed her and she killed three and badly wounded Old John . `` We've got to get her out of there '' ! Jones yelled , `` or she'll kill 'em all . Bring me the firecrackers '' . For such an emergency he had included Fourth-of-July cannon crackers as part of their equipment . Lighting one he pitched it into the crevice , and the lioness left off mauling the dogs and departed . `` Ain't she a beauty , though '' ? Called out Means as she ran . `` Don't you go a step nearer her than I do '' , Jones warned , `` and if you do , go at a run so you'll have momentum '' ! For two hours they drove her from one strong point to another along the side of the Reef , trying to maneuver her onto the plain where they could get a good throw . But she clung to the rocks and brush , and the day wore away . It was hot . The dogs were tired . The men were tired too . It was the story of the rhinoceros fight all over again . And the sun was beginning to go down . If dark came they would lose her . `` I'll get a pole '' , Jones said finally , `` and I'll poke a noose over her head '' ! At this moment she was crouched in a cave-like aperture halfway down the Reef . Ulyate made no comment but his face showed what he thought of poking ropes over lions' heads with poles , and of course these were the lions of fifty years ago , not the gentler ones of today , and this one was angry , with good reason . Loveless , too , objected . `` It won't work , Colonel '' . `` Just the same we'll try it '' . But without waiting for them to try it , she scattered the dogs and shot down the Reef and out across the plain . John led the chase after her and the other dogs strung out behind , many of them trailing blood . John himself was bruised and clawed from head to tail , but he was in this fight to the finish , running almost as strongly now as in the morning . She took refuge on a tongue of land extending into a gully , crouched at the base of a thorn tree , and waited for them to come up . She had chosen the spot well . With the gully on three sides , she could be approached only along the tongue of land . `` Careful , now '' , Jones warned . Means tried her first . Very slowly he maneuvered his rawboned bay gelding , edging closer , watching for a chance to throw , but ready to spin and run , rope whining about his head , horse edging tensely under him , but the gelding was obedient and responded and was not paralyzed by the close proximity of the lion . They tell you horses go crazy at the sight or smell of a bear or a lion , but these didn't . Means edged closer . She snarled warningly . Means spit and edged on . Again she snarled , and again he edged . The pony was sidewise to her . With a whirling jump , it could get into gear . However nothing on four legs was supposed to be faster than a lion over a short distance , unless it was a cheetah . She charged . Means spun and spurred . For thirty yards she gained rapidly . She was closing and within one more bound would have been able to reach the rear end of the bay , but -- and here Jones and Loveless and Ulyate were holding breath for all they were worth -- she never quite caught up that last bound . Means held steady one jump ahead of her . Then gradually he began to pull away . A Western cowpony had outrun an African lion , from a standing start . Photos showed later that she'd been about six feet from Means . Of course the factor of head start made all the difference . How much head start ? No one knew exactly . That was the whole question . Enough , was the answer . The lioness quickly changed front , when she saw she couldn't catch Means , and made for Jones . As she had done with Means , she gained rapidly at first , but then Baldy began to draw away . Somewhere in the few scant yards of head start was the determining point . When Jones too drew away , she returned to a thorn bush in the neck of land running into the gully , crouched low and waited as before . This new position , however , gave the ropers a better chance . There was room to make a quick dash past the bush and throw as you went . So : Means edged around on the north side of her , Jones moved in from the south . Tossing his rope and shouting he attracted her attention . He succeeded almost too well , because once she rose as if to charge , and he half wheeled his horse -- he was within fifty feet -- but she sank back . From behind her Means shot forward at a run . Kearton began shouting , `` Wait , wait -- the camera's jammed '' ! But Means kept on . He raced by within twenty feet of her , roped her around the neck , but a lioness' neck is short and thick and with a quick twist she slipped the noose off . The missionary obligation to proclaim the gospel to all the world was once left to zealous individuals and voluntary societies . But the time came when a church that had no part in the missionary movement was looked upon as deficient in its essential life . The Christian education of children , too , was once hardly more than a sideshow , but the day came when a congregation that did not assume full oversight of a church school was thought of as failing in its duty . The most serious weakness of the ecumenical movement today is that it is generally regarded as the responsibility of a few national leaders in each denomination and a few interdenominational executives . Most pastors and laymen , even though they believe it to be important , assume that the ecumenical movement lies outside the province of their parishes . They may even dismiss it from their minds as something that concerns only the `` ecclesiastical Rover Boys '' , as someone has dubbed them , who like to go to national and international assemblies , and have expense accounts that permit them to do so . As long as this point of view prevails , the ecumenical movement will be lame and halt . The next stage ahead is that of making it thoroughly at home in the local community . Progress will take place far less through what is done in any `` summit conference '' of the National Council or the World Council , or even in offices of the denominational boards , than through what happens in the communities where Christian people live together as neighbors . The front line of advance is where witnessing and worshiping congregations of different traditions exist side by side . Until they see the ecumenical movement in terms of the difference it makes in their own attitudes , programs , and relationships , it will have an inevitable aspect of unreality . As things now stand , there is a grievous disparity between the unity in Christ which we profess in ecumenical meetings and the complacent separateness of most congregations on any Main Street in the nation . The ecumenical congregation The crux of ecumenical advance is an even more personalized matter than the relation between congregations in the same community . The decisive question is what happens within each congregation and , finally , in the minds and hearts of the individual members . It is here that the local and ecumenical must meet . It is here that the ecumenical must become local and the local become ecumenical . It has become almost trite to say that the ecumenical movement must be `` carried down to the grass roots '' . This way of describing the matter is unfortunate . It implies two misconceptions . One is that whatever is ecumenical has to do with some over-all organization at `` the top '' and needs only to be understood at the so-called `` lower levels '' . The truth , however , is that the ecumenical church is just the local church in its own true character as an integral unit of the whole People of God throughout the world . The other misconception is that our ecumenical problems will be solved if only the knowledge of the church in its world-wide extension and its interdenominational connections , now comprehended by many national leaders , can be communicated to all congregations . However needed this may be , the fundamental problem is not information but active commitment to the total mission of the church of Christ in the world . The basic unit in the church , of whatever denominational polity , is always the congregation . It is hardly possible to emphasize this too much . Most people do not realize that the congregation , as a gathered fellowship meeting regularly face to face , personally sharing in a common experience and expressing that experience in daily relationships with one another , is unique . The idea that it is a feature of all religions is entirely mistaken . The Jewish synagogue affords a parallel to the Christian congregation , but Hinduism , Buddhism , Islam , Confucianism , Taoism , Shintoism , although they have sacred scriptures , priests , spiritual disciplines , and places of prayer , do not have a congregation as a local household of faith and love . Their characteristic experience is that of the individual at an altar or a shrine rather than that of a continuing social group with a distinctive kind of fellowship . How far the fellowship in most local churches falls below what the New Testament means by koinonia ! What is now called Christian fellowship is often little more than the social chumminess of having a gracious time with the kind of people one likes . The koinonia of Acts and of the Epistles means sharing in a common relation to Christ . It is an experience of a new depth of community derived from an awareness of the corporate indwelling of Christ in His people . As Dietrich Bonhoffer puts it , `` Our community with one another consists solely in what Christ has done to both of us '' . This may mean having fellowship in the church with people with whom , on the level of merely human agreeableness , we might prefer not to have any association at all . There is a vast difference between the community of reconciliation which the New Testament describes and the community of congeniality found in the average church building . Whenever a congregation really sees itself as a unit in the universal Church , in vital relation with the whole Body of Christ and participating in His mission to the world , a necessary foundation-stone of the ecumenical movement has been laid . The antithesis of the ecumenical and the local then no longer exists . The local and the ecumenical are one . Of course , the perspective of those who are dealing directly with the world-wide problems of the People of God will always be different from the perspective of those who are dealing with the nearby problems of particular persons in a particular place . Each viewpoint is valid if it is organically related to the other . Neither is adequate if it stands alone . Our difficulty arises when either viewpoint shuts out the other . And this is what all too often happens . Divergent perspectives A little parable illustrative of this truth is afforded by an incident related by Professor Bela Vasady at the end of the Second World War . With great difficulty he made his way from his native Hungary to Geneva to renew his contacts as a member of the Provisional Committee for the World Council of Churches . When he had the mishap of breaking his spectacles , his ecumenical colleagues insisted on providing him with new ones . They were bifocals . He often spoke of them as his `` ecumenical '' glasses and used them as a symbol of the kind of vision that is required in the church . It is , he said , a bifocal vision , which can see both the near-at-hand and the distant and keep a Christian in right relation to both . As things stand now , the local and the ecumenical tend to compete with each other . On the one hand , there are ecumenists who are so stirred by the crises of the church in its encounter with the world at large that they have no eyes for what the church is doing in their own town . They do not escape the pitfall into which Charles Dickens pictured Mrs. Jellyby as falling . Her concern for the natives of Borrioboola-Gha was so intense that she quite forgot and neglected her son Peepy ! Likewise , the ecumenist may become so absorbed in the conflict of the church with the totalitarian state in East Germany , the precarious situation of the church in revolutionary China , and the anguish of the church over apartheid in South Africa that he loses close contact with the parish church in its unspectacular but indispensable ministry of worship , pastoral service and counseling , and Christian nurture for a face-to-face group of individuals . On the other hand , many a pastor is so absorbed in ministering to the intimate , personal needs of individuals in his congregation that he does little or nothing to lead them into a sense of social responsibility and world mission . As a result , they go on thinking of the church , with introverted and self-centered satisfaction , only in connection with the way in which it serves them and their families . It would hardly be an exaggeration to say that ninety per cent of the energy of most churches -- whether in terms of finance or spiritual concern -- is poured into the private and domestic interests of the members . The parish lives for itself rather than for the community or the world . The gap between the ecumenical perspective and the parish perspective appears most starkly in a church in any of our comfortable suburbs . It is eminently successful according to all conventional standards . It is growing in numbers . Its people are agreeable friends . It has a beautiful edifice . Its preaching and its music give refreshment of spirit to men and women living under heavy strain . It provides pastoral care for the sick and troubled . It helps children grow up with at least a nodding acquaintance with the Bible . It draws young people into the circle of those who continue the life of the church from generation to generation . And it is easy for the ecumenical enthusiast to lose sight of how basic all this is . But what is this church doing to help its members understand their roles as Christians in the world ? All too often its conception of parish ministry and pastoral care includes no responsibility for them in their relation to issues of the most desperate urgency for the life of mankind . It is not stirring them to confront the racial tensions of today with the mind of Christ . It is not helping them face the moral crisis involved in the use of nuclear energy . It is not making them sensitive to the sub-Christian level of much of our economic and industrial life . It is raising no disturbing question as to what Christian stewardship means for the relationship of the richest nation in the world to economically underdeveloped peoples . It is not developing an awareness of the new kind of missionary strategy that is called for as young churches emerge in Asia and Africa . To put it bluntly , many a local church is giving its members only what they consciously want . It is not disturbing them by thoughts of their Christian responsibility in relation to the world . We shall not make a decisive advance in the ecumenical movement until such a church begins to see itself not merely as a haven of comfort and peace but as a base of Christian witness and mission to the world . There is a humorous but revealing story about a rancher who owned a large slice of Texas and who wanted to have on it everything that was necessary for a completely pleasant community . He built a school and a library , then a recreation center and an inn . Desiring to fill the only remaining lack , he selected the best site on the ranch for a chapel and spared no expense in erecting it . A visitor to the beautiful little building inquired , `` Do you belong to this church , Mr. Rancher '' ? `` Why , no , ma'am '' , he replied , `` this church belongs to me '' ! The story reflects the way too many people feel . As long as the congregation regards the church as `` our '' church , or the minister thinks of it as `` my '' church , just so long the ecumenical movement will make no significant advance . There must first be a deeper sense that the church belongs not to us but to Christ , and that it is His purpose , not our own interests and preferences , that determines what it is to be and do . Local embodiment of the whole A local church which conceives its function to be entirely that of ministering to the conscious desires and concerns of its members tends to look on everything ecumenical as an extra , not as a normal aspect of its own life as a church . It would doubtless be greatly surprised to be told that in failing to be ecumenical it is really failing to be the Church of Christ . Yet the truth , according to the New Testament , is that every local church has its existence only by being the embodiment of the whole church in that particular place . Yet a crowd came out to see some fresh kids from the city try to match the boys from the neighboring farms ; ; and buggies and wagons and chugging Fords kept gathering all morning , until the edges of the field were packed thick and small boys kept scampering out on the playing field to make fun of the visitors -- whose pitcher was a formidable looking young man with the only baseball cap . This was a bitterly fought game , carrying almost as much grudge as a fist fight , with no friendliness exhibited between the teams except the formal politeness that accompanied the setting forth of ground rules and agreements on balls that went into the crowd . Every pitch in the game brought forth a howl from the enraptured audience and every fly ball the visitors dropped ( and because their right fielder was still a little fuzzy from drink , they dropped many ) called forth yelps of derision . At one point in the game when the skinny old man in suspenders who was acting as umpire got in the way of a thrown ball and took it painfully in the kidneys , he lay there unattended while players and spectators wrangled over whether the ball was `` dead '' or the base runners were free to score . This was typical of such games , which were earnestly played to win and practically never wound up in an expression of good fellowship . When the visitors , after losing this game , rode along the village streets toward home , the youngsters who could keep abreast of them for a moment or two screamed triumphantly , `` You bunch of hay-shakers ! G'ahn back home ! You hay-shakers '' ! Baseball was surely the national game in those days , even though professional baseball may have been merely a business . Radio broadcasts had not begun and most devotees of baseball attended the games near home , in the town park or a pasture , with perhaps two or three trips to the city each season to see the Cubs or the Pirates or the Indians or the Red Sox . Young men in school could look forward to playing ball for money in a dozen different places , even if they failed to make the major leagues . Nearly any lad with a modicum of skill might find a payday awaiting him in the Three I League , or the Pony League , or the Coastal Plains League , or the fast Eastern League , if not indeed in one of the hundreds of city leagues that abounded everywhere . Even a city of thirty thousand might have six baseball teams , sponsored by grocers and hardware merchants or department stores , that played two or three times a week throughout the summer , usually in the cool of the evening , before an earnest and partisan audience who did not begrudge a quarter each , or even more , to be dropped into a hat when the game was half over . Babe Ruth , of course , was everyone's hero , and everyone knew him , even though relatively few ever saw him play ball . His face was always in the newspapers , sometimes in cartoons that seemed nearly as large as life . As the twenties grew older , and as radio broadcasts of baseball games began to involve more and more people daily in the doings of the professionals , the great hitters ( always led by Babe Ruth ) overshadowed the game so that pitchers were nearly of no account . Boys no longer bothered learning to bunt and even school kids scorned to `` choke up '' on a bat as Willie Keeler and the famous hitters of another day had done . Other hitters bloomed with more or less vigor in the news and a few even dared to dream of matching Ruth , who was still called Jidge by all his friends , or Leo or Two-Head by those who dared to taunt him ( Leo was the name of the ball player he liked the least ) and who called most of the world `` Kid '' . Lou Gehrig was given the nickname Buster , and he ran Ruth a close race in home runs . But the nickname never stuck and Gehrig was no match for Ruth in `` color '' -- which is sometimes a polite word for delinquent behavior on and off the field . Ruth was a delinquent boy still , but he was in every way a great ball player who was out to win the game and occasionally risked a cracked bone to do it . A few professional baseball players cultivated eccentricities , with the encouragement of the press , so that they might see their names in big black print , along with Daddy Browning's , Al Capone's , Earl Sande's , and the Prince of Wales' . One who , for a time , succeeded best and was still the sorriest of all was Charles Arthur Shires , who called himself , in the newspapers , Art the Great , or The Great Shires . It was his brag that he could beat everybody at anything , but especially at fighting , and he once took on the manager of his club and worked him over thoroughly with his fists . He was given to public carousing and to acting the clown on the diamond ; ; and a policeman asserted he had found a pair of brass knuckles in Art's pocket once when he had occasion to collar the Great First Baseman for some forgotten reason . ( This made a sportswriter named Pegler wonder in print if Art had worn this armament when he defeated his manager . ) The sorry fact about this young man , who was barely of age when he broke into major-league baseball , was that he really was a better ball player than he was given credit for being -- never so good as he claimed , and always an irritant to his associates , but a good steady performer when he could fight down the temptation to orate on his skills or cut up in public . In his minor way Charles Arthur Shires was perhaps more typical of his era than Ruth was , for he was but one of many young men who laid waste their talents in these Scott Fitzgerald days for the sake of earning space in the newspapers . There were others who climbed flagpoles and refused to come down ; ; or who ingested strange objects , like live fish ; ; or who undertook to set records for remaining erect on a dance floor , with or without a partner ; ; or who essayed to down full bottles of illicit gin without pausing for breath . One young man , exhilarated to the point of insanity by liquor and the excitement of the moment , performed a perfect swan dive out of the stands at the Yale Bowl during the Yale-Army football game , landed squarely on his head on the concrete ramp below , and died at once . But the twenties were not all insanity and a striving after recognition . The business of baseball began to prosper along with other entertainments , and performers -- thanks partly to George Herman Ruth's spectacular efforts each season to run his salary higher and higher -- prospered too . While fifty years before , Albert Goodwill Spalding , secretary of the Chicago Ball Club of the National League , could write earnestly to the manager of the Buffalo club and request a guarantee of one hundred dollars for a baseball game in August , in this Golden Era a game at the Yankee Stadium might bring in nearly a hundred thousand dollars at the gate . And while less than ten years earlier the wayward Black Sox -- all of them top performers in their positions -- had toiled for stingy Charles Comiskey at salaries ranging from twenty-five hundred dollars to forty-five hundred dollars a year , stars now were asking ten thousand dollars , twenty thousand dollars , yes , even fifty thousand dollars a season . The greatest team of this period was unquestionably the New York Yankees , bought by brewery millions and made into a ball club by men named Ed Barrow and Miller Huggins . Boston fans sometimes liked to wring some wry satisfaction out of the fact that most of the great 1923-27 crew were graduates of the Red Sox -- sold to millionaires Huston and Ruppert by a man who could not deny them their most trifling desire . Ruth himself , still owning his farm in Massachusetts and an interest in the Massachusetts cigar business that printed his round boyish face on the wrappers , had led the parade down from Fenway Park , followed by pitchers Carl Mays , Leslie `` Joe '' Bush , Waite Hoyt , Herb Pennock , and Sam Jones , catcher Wally Schang , third baseman Joe Dugan ( who completed the `` playboy trio '' of Ruth , Dugan , and Hoyt ) , and shortstop Everett Scott . By 1926 , when the mighty Yanks were at their mightiest , only a few of these were left but they still shone brightest , even beside able and agile rookies like Tony Lazzeri ( who managed never to have one of his epileptic fits on the field ) , Mark Koenig , Lou Gehrig , George Pipgras , and gray-thatched Earl Combs . The deeds of this team , through two seasons and in the two World's Series that followed , have been written and talked about until hardly a word is left to be said . But there is one small episode that a few New York fans who happened to sit in the cheap seats for one World's Series game in 1926 like best to recall . Babe Ruth , as he always did in the Stadium , played right field to avoid having the sun in his eyes , and Tommy Thevenow , a rather mediocre hitter who played shortstop for the St. Louis Cardinals , knocked a ball with all his might into the sharp angle formed by the permanent stands and the wooden bleachers , where Ruth could not reach it . The ball lay there , shining white on the grass in view of nearly every fan in the park while Ruth , red-necked with frustration , charged about the small patch of ground screaming , `` Where's the -- -ing ball '' ? But , as he snarled unhappily when the inning was over , `` not a sonofabitch in the place would tell me '' , so little Tommy ran all the way home . The ordinary man and woman , however , saw little of the great professional games of those Golden Days , or of any other sporting event for that matter . Promoters always hastened to place their choice tickets in the hands of the wealthy speculators , and only the man who knew the man who knew the fellow who had an in with the guy at the box office ever came up with a good seat for a contest of any importance . Radio broadcasts , however -- now that even plain people could afford `` loud speakers '' on their sets -- held old fans to the major-league races and attracted new ones , chiefly women , who through what the philosopher called the ineluctable modality of audition , became first inured , then attracted , then addicted to the long afternoon recitals of the doings in some distant baseball park . In some cities games were broadcast throughout the week and then on weekends the announcer was silenced , and fans must needs drive to the city from all the broadcast area to discover how their heroes were faring . This had a pleasant effect upon the Sunday gate receipts as well as upon the intake of the rail and bus companies , some of which began to offer special excursion rates , including seats at the park , just as the trolley and ferry companies had when baseball was new . While women had always attended ball games in small numbers ( it was the part of a `` dead game sport '' in the early years of the twentieth century to be taken out to the ball park and to root , root , root for the home team ) , they had often sat in patient martyrdom , unable even to read the scoreboard , which sometimes seemed to indicate that one team led another by a score of three hundred and eighty to one hundred and fifty-one . The questions women asked at baseball games were standard grist for amateur comedy , as were the doings of women automobile drivers ; ; for every grown man ( except a few who were always suspected of being shy on virility ) knew at least the fundamentals of baseball , just as every male American in this era liked to imagine ( or pretend ) that he could fight with his fists . And women were not expected to know that the pitcher was trying not to let the batter hit the ball . Radio , however , so increased the interest of women in the game that it was hardly necessary even to have `` Ladies' Days '' any longer to enable men to get to the ball park without interference at home . Women actually began to appear unaccompanied in the stands , where they still occasionally ran the risk of coming home with a tobacco-juice stain on a clean skirt or a new curse word tingling their ears . The radio broadcasts themselves were often so patiently informative , despite the baseball jargon , that girls and women could begin to store up in their minds the same sort of random and meaningless statistics that small boys had long learned better than they ever did their lessons in school . This conclusion is dependent on the assumption that traditional sex mores will continue to sanction both premarital chastity as the `` ideal '' , and the double standard holding females primarily responsible for preserving the ideal . Our discussion of this involves using Erik Erikson's schema of `` identity vs. identity diffusion '' as a conceptual tool in superimposing a few common denominators onto the diverse personality and family configurations of the unwed mothers from whose case histories we quoted earlier . Our discussion does not utilize all the identity crises postulated by Erikson , but is intended to demonstrate the utility of his theoretical schema for studying unwed mothers . We hope thereby to emphasize that , from a psychological standpoint , the effectual prevention of illegitimacy is a continuous long-term process involving the socialization of the female from infancy through adolescence . Hypothesizing a series of developmental stages that begin in the individual's infancy and end in his old age , Erikson has indicated that the adolescent is faced with a series of identity crises . The successful and positive resolution of these crises during adolescence involves an epigenetic principle -- during adolescence , the individual's positive resolutions in each area of identity crisis depend , to a considerable degree , on his already having resolved preliminary and preparatory identity crises during his infancy , childhood , and early adolescence . Within Erikson's schema , the adolescent's delinquent behavior -- in this case , her unwed motherhood -- reflects her `` identity diffusion '' , or her inability to resolve these various identity crises positively . The adolescent experiences identity crises in terms of time perspective vs. time diffusion . Time perspective -- the ability to plan for the future and to postpone gratifying immediate wants in order to achieve long-range objectives -- is more easily developed if , from infancy on , the individual has been able to rely on and trust people and the world in which she lives . Erikson has noted that , unless this trust developed early , the time ambivalence experienced , in varying degree and temporarily , by all adolescents ( as a result of their remembering the more immediate gratification of wants during childhood , while not yet having fully accepted the long-range planning required by adulthood ) may develop into a more permanent sense of time diffusion . Experience of this time diffusion ranges from a sense of utter apathy to a feeling of desperate urgency to act immediately . These polar extremes in time diffusion were indicated in some of the comments by unwed mothers reported in earlier chapters . Some of these mothers , apparently feeling a desperate urgency , made , on the spur of the moment , commitments , in love and sex , that would have life-long consequences . Others displayed utter apathy and indifference to any decision about the past or the future . For many of these unwed mothers , the data on their family life and early childhood experiences revealed several indications and sources of their basic mistrust of their parents in particular and of the world in general . However , as Erickson has noted , the individual's failure to develop preliminary identities during infancy and childhood need not be irreversibly deterministic with respect to a given area of identity diffusion in his ( or her ) adolescence . And , as shown in Chapter 6 , , some SNP females originally developed such trust only during their adolescence , through the aid of , and their identification with , alter-parents . In the specific case of time diffusion , we must emphasize the significance of the earlier development of mistrust when it is combined with the inevitable time crisis experienced by most ( if not all ) adolescents in our society , and with the failure of the adolescent period to provide opportunities for developing trust . The adolescent experiences two closely related crises : self-certainty vs. an identity consciousness ; ; and role-experimentation vs. negative identity . A sense of self-certainty and the freedom to experiment with different roles , or confidence in one's own unique behavior as an alternative to peer-group conformity , is more easily developed during adolescence if , during early childhood , the individual was permitted to exercise initiative and encouraged to develop some autonomy . However , if the child has been constantly surrounded , during nursery and early school age , by peer groups ; ; inculcated with the primacy of group acceptance and group standards ; ; and allowed little initiative in early play and work patterns -- then in adolescence her normal degree of vanity , sensitivity , and preoccupation with whether others find her appearance and behavior acceptable , will be compounded . Her ostensible indifference to and rebellion against suggestions and criticisms by anyone except peer friends during adolescence are the manifestations , in her adolescence , of her having been indoctrinated in childhood to feel shame , if not guilt , for failing to behave in a manner acceptable to , and judged by , the performance of her nursery- and elementary-school peer friends . To be different is to invite shame and doubt ; ; and it is better to be shamed and criticized by one's parents , who already consider one different and difficult to understand , than by one's peers , who are also experiencing a similar groping for and denial of adult status . The attitudes of some unwed mothers quoted in Chapter 2 , , revealed both considerable preoccupation with being accepted by others and a marked absence of self-certainty . Many appeared to regard their sexual behavior as a justifiable means of gaining acceptance from and identification with others ; ; but very few seemed aware that such acceptance and identification need to be supplemented with more enduring and stable identification of and with one's self . Another identity crisis confronting the adolescent involves anticipation of achievement vs. work-paralysis . The adolescent's capacity to anticipate achievement and to exercise the self-discipline necessary to complete tasks successfully depends on the degree to which he or she developed autonomy , initiative , and self-discipline during childhood . The developmental process involves the individual's progressively experiencing a sense of dignity and achievement resulting from having completed tasks , having kept commitments , and having created something ( however small or simple -- even a doll dress of one's own design rather than in the design `` it ought to be '' ) . These childhood experiences are sources of the self-certainty that the adolescent needs , for experimenting with many roles , and for the freedom to fail sometimes in the process of exploring and discovering her skills and abilities . If she has not had such experiences , the female's normal adolescent degree of indecision will be compounded . She may well be incapacitated by it when she is confronted with present and future alternatives -- e.g. , whether to prepare primarily for a career or for the role of a homemaker ; ; whether to stay financially dependent on her parents or help support herself while attending school ; ; whether to pursue a college education or a job after high school ; ; and whether to attend this or that college and to follow this or that course of study . Erikson has noted that , as this indecision mounts , it may result in a `` paralysis of workmanship '' . This paralysis may be expressed in the female's starting -- and never completing -- many jobs , tasks , and courses of study ; ; and in the fact that she bases her decisions about work , college , carreer , and studies on what others are doing , rather than on her own sense of identity with given skills , abilities , likes , and dislikes . The absence , during her childhood and early adolescence , of experiences in developing the self-discipline to complete tasks within her ability -- experiences that would have been subsequent sources of anticipation of achievement -- and her lack of childhood opportunities to practice autonomy and initiative in play and expression , both tend in her adolescence to deprive her of the freedoms to role-experiment and to fail occasionally in experimenting . The comments made by some unwed mothers ( quoted in Chapter 2 ) ) reflect this paralysis of workmanship . They attended school and selected courses primarily on the basis of decisions others made ; ; they accepted a job primarily because it was available , convenient , and paid reasonably . These things both express and , at the same time , continue contributing to , their identity diffusion in an area that could have become a source of developing dignity and self-certainty . As their identity diffusion increased , they became more susceptible to sporadic diversions in love and sexual affairs . These affairs temporarily relieved the monotony of school or work activities containing no anticipation of achievement and joy of craftsmanship , no sense of dignity derived from a job well done . Childhood experiences in learning work and self-discipline habits within a context of developing autonomy and initiative have considerable significance for the prevention of illegitimacy . The excerpts from case histories presented above confirm this significance , though through different facets of experience . For example , some unwed mothers had had no work experiences , household chores , and responsibilities during childhood and early adolescence ; ; they subsequently occupied their leisure hours in searching for something exciting and diverting . Sex was both . On the other hand , some unwed mothers had had so much work and responsibility imposed on them at an early age , and had thus had so little freedom or opportunity to develop autonomy and initiative , that their work and responsibilities became dull and unrewarding burdens -- to be escaped and rebelled against through fun and experimentation with forbidden sexual behavior . The adolescent also faces the identity crisis that Erikson has termed ideological polarization vs. diffusion of ideals . In discussing the ways this crisis is germane to consderations for the prevention of illegitimacy , we shall again superimpose Erikson's concept on our data . Adolescents have a much-discussed tendency to polarize ideas and values , to perceive things as `` either-or '' , black or white -- nuances of meaning are relatively unimportant . This tendency is , perhaps , most clearly revealed in the literature on religious conversions and experiences of adolescents . Erikson has postulated that such ideological polarization temporarily resolves their search for something stable and definite in the rapidly changing and fluctuating no-man's-land between childhood and adulthood . It provides identification -- with an idea , a value , a cause that cuts through , or even transcends , the multiple and ambivalent identities of their passage from child to adult , and permits their forceful and overt expression of emotion . The positive development , during adolescence , of this capacity to think and to feel strongly and with increasing independence , and to identify overtly either with or against given ideas , values , and practices , depends to a considerable degree on both previous and present opportunities for developing autonomy , initiative , and self-certainty . Most adolescents have some ideological diffusion at various developmental stages , as they experience a proliferation of ideas and values . The diffusion is most pronounced and most likely to become fixed , however , in those who have had no or very minimal opportunities to develop the autonomy and initiative that could have been directed into constructive expression and so served as sources of developing self-certainty . A pronounced ideological diffusion -- i.e. , inability to identify independently with given ideas and value systems -- is reflected in many ways . For example , it is evinced by the adolescent ( or adult ) whose beliefs and actions represent primarily his rebellion and reaction against the ideas and behavior patterns of others , rather than his inner conviction and choice . It is mirrored by the individual Willie Lohmans , whose ideas and behavior patterns are so dependent and relativistic that they always coincide with those of the individual or group present and most important at the moment . In another sense , it is represented in the arguments of the `` true believers '' who seek to disprove the validity of all other beliefs and ideas in order to retain confidence in theirs . The case histories provide some interesting illustrations of ideological diffusion , embodied in the unwed mother's inability to identify independently a given value system or behavior pattern , , and her subsequent disinclination to assume any individual responsibility for her sexual behavior . For example , the unwed mothers expressed their frustration with males who did not indicate more explicitly `` what it is they really want from a girl so one can act accordingly '' . They were disappointed by the physical and emotional hurt of premarital sexual intercourse . They condemned the movie script writers for implying that sex was enjoyable and exhilarating . They criticized parents for never having emphasized traditional concepts of right and wrong ; ; and they censured parents who `` never disciplined and were too permissive '' or who `` never explained how easy it was to get pregnant '' . In the adult world , there are a number of rather general and diffuse sources of ideological diffusion that further compound the adolescent's search for meaning during this particular identity crisis . For example , some contemporary writing tends to fuse the `` good guys '' and the `` bad guys '' , to portray the weak people as heroes and weakness as a virtue , and to explain ( or even justify ) asocial behavior by attributing it to deterministic psychological , familial , and social experiences . In the final accounting , these would have augmented the bill for both sides . An estimate of one million dollars is probably not excessive . Yet the huge amount of money consumed by the Selden litigation , which many regarded as wasteful , indirectly contributed to constructive changes in legal procedure . The duration and other circumstances of the Selden case made it a flagrant example of the gross abuses of patent infringement actions . The suit , as we have seen , came before the courts when patent attorneys , inventors , and laymen were making mounting demands for reforms in the American patent system . Chief among the defects they singled out were the complicated and wearisome procedures in equity . In a long and angry footnote to his opinion , Judge Hough had lent the weight of judicial condemnation to such criticism . `` It is a duty '' , said Hough , `` not to let pass this opportunity of protesting against the methods of taking and printing testimony in Equity , current in this circuit ( and probably others ) , excused if not justified by the rules of the Supreme Court , especially to be found in patent causes , and flagrantly exemplified in this litigation . As long as the bar prefers to adduce evidence by written deposition , rather than viva voce before an authoritative judicial officer , I fear that the antiquated rules will remain unchanged , and expensive prolixity remain the best known characteristic of Equity '' . Observing that `` reforms sometimes begin with the contemplation of horrible examples '' , Hough catalogued the many abuses encouraged by existing procedures . He cited the elephantine dimensions of the Selden case record ; ; the duplication of testimony and exhibits ; ; the numerous squabbles over minor matters ; ; the `` objections stated at outrageous length '' ; ; and the frequent and rancorous verbal bouts , `` uncalled for and unjustifiable , from the retort discourteous to the lie direct '' . The fundamental difficulty of which the Selden case was `` a striking ( though not singular ) example '' , concluded Hough , `` will remain as long as testimony is taken without any authoritative judicial officer present , and responsible for the maintenance of discipline , and the reception or exclusion of testimony '' . Not least among the members of the patent bar who echoed this powerful indictment were those who had participated in the Selden suit . William A. Redding asserted that if the case had been heard in open court under rules of evidence , the testimony would have been completed in sixty days instead of five years . Inventors joined lawyers in the clamor for reform , inevitably centering upon the Selden litigation as a `` horrible example '' . Its costive deliberations were likened to those of the British courts of chancery mercilessly caricatured by Dickens in Bleak House . Parker , who agreed with much of this criticism , did not conceal his dissatisfaction with procedural defects . But he felt that the Selden case was being unfairly pilloried . In a detailed letter published in the Scientific American in 1912 , he remarked that `` loose statements '' about the case showed scant understanding of the facts . The suit , although commonly designated as a single action , actually embraced five cases . Parker insisted that the size of the record would have been drastically reduced but for an unavoidable duplication of testimony . In a private communication written in 1911 , Parker had been more to the point . Noting the complaints of inventors and members of the patent bar , he admitted that some of the strictures `` were fairly well founded '' , but he added that under existing rules the courts could not consolidate testimony in a group of suits involving separate infringements of the same patent . The vast industrial interests caught up in the Selden suit , as well as the complex character of the automotive art , encouraged both sides to exploit `` every possible chance '' for or against the patent , said Parker . `` This very seldom happens in this class or in other cases , and of course all of these matters led to a volume and an expense of the record beyond what ordinarily would occur '' . Parker listed the remedies he deemed essential for reducing the cost and mass of testimony . The most important of these found him in agreement with Hough's plea for reform . Parker called for abolition of the indiscriminate or uncontrolled right of taking depositions before officers of the court who had no authority to limit testimony . The taking of depositions , he suggested , should be placed under a special court examiner empowered to compel responsive and relevant answers and to exclude immaterial testimony . `` I am satisfied that in the Selden case had this power existed and this course ( been ) pursued , it would have shortened the depositions of some of the experts nearly one-half and of some of the other witnesses thereto more than that '' . In the end Hough's acidulous protest , which Parker called the `` now somewhat famous note on this ' Selden ' case '' , did not go unheeded . In 1912 the United States Supreme Court adopted a new set of rules of equity which became effective on February 1 , 1913 . The revised procedure was acclaimed as a long-overdue reform . Under the new rules , testimony is taken orally in open court in all cases except those of an extraordinary character . Other expeditious methods are designed to prevent prolixity , limit delays , and reduce the expense of infringement suits . One of the A.L.A.M. lawyers observed that if the Selden case had been tried under this simplified procedure , the testimony which filled more than a score of volumes , `` at a minimum cost of $1 a page for publication alone , could have been contained in one volume '' . While patent suits are still among the most complex and expensive forms of litigation , these rules have saved litigants uncounted sums of money . There is little doubt that they were promulgated by the Supreme Court as a direct result of the Selden patent suit . 3 . Even before it was formally dissolved in 1912 , the A.L.A.M. was succeeded by the Automobile Board of Trade , the direct lineal ancestor of the present-day Automobile Manufacturers Association . The trade bodies which came in the wake of the A.L.A.M. were more representative , for they never adopted a policy of exclusion . Nevertheless , it is from the Selden organization that the industry inherited its institutional machinery for furthering the broader interests of the trade . One of the chief features of this community of interest is the automotive patents cross-licensing agreement , a milestone in the development of American industrial cooperation . Its origin lies in the Selden patent controversy and its aftermath . From the earliest days of the motor car industry , before the A.L.A.M. was established , patent infringement loomed as a serious and vexing problem . Many patent contests were waged over automobile components and accessories , among them tires , detachable rims , ball bearings , license brackets , and electric horns . The fluidity and momentum of the young industry abetted a general disregard of patent claims . As early as 1900 a Wall Street combination acquired detail patents with the intention of exacting heavy tribute from automobile manufacturers . This scheme failed , and the following decade brought a deluge of infringement suits among individual manufacturers that reached its crest in 1912 . In this tangle of conflicting claims , the patent-sharing scheme adopted by the A.L.A.M. at its founding proved to be the best device for avoiding or mitigating the burdens of incessant litigation . The interchange of shop licenses for a nominal royalty eliminated infringement suits among the members of the A.L.A.M. patent pool ( although it did not protect them against outside actions ) and kept open channels for the cross-fertilization of automotive technology . One of the conditions of the pool was a prohibition upon the withholding of patent rights among A.L.A.M. members . Within its limits , this arrangement had the actual or potential characteristics of a cross-licensing agreement . Its positive features outweighed the fact that the pool was an adjunct of a wouldbe monopoly . Since the A.L.A.M. holdings embraced only about twenty-five per cent of motor vehicle patents , the denial of rights to independent companies did not retard technical progress in unlicensed sectors of the industry . The highly important Dyer patents on the sliding gear transmission were held by the A.L.A.M. pool . But Henry Ford used the planetary transmission in his Model T and earlier cars and , in 1905 , as a precautionary measure , took out a license from the man who claimed to be its inventor . For those affiliated with it , the A.L.A.M. pool was a haven from the infringement actions involving detail patents that beset the industry with mounting intensity after 1900 . By 1910 the courts were crowded with cases , many of them brought by freebooters who trafficked in disputed inventions . It was commonplace for auto makers , parts-suppliers , and dealers to find warning notices and threats of infringement suits in their daily mail . `` Purely from the business man's standpoint and without regard to the lawyer's view '' , commented a trade journal , `` the matter of patents in the automobile and accessory trade is developing some phases and results that challenge thought as to how far patents are to become weapons of warfare in business , instead of simple beneficient protection devices for encouraging inventive creation '' . Occasionally new enterprise was discouraged by the almost certain prospect of legal complications . One manufacturer who held an allegedly basic patent said : `` I would readily put over $50,000 into the manufacture of the device , but it is so easy to make that we would enter immediately into a prolonged ordeal of patent litigation which would eat up all our profits '' . The prevailing view in the industry was summed up in 1912 by a group of auto makers who told a Senate committee : `` The exceedingly unsatisfactory and uselessly expensive conditions , including delays surrounding legal disputes , particularly in patent litigation , are items of industrial burden which must be written large in figures of many millions of dollars of industrial waste '' . By that time it was commonly agreed that patent warfare was sapping constructive achievement and blocking the free exchange of technical information . At this point Charles C. Hanch , long an advocate of patent peace in the industry , became chairman of the patents committee of the National Automobile Chamber of Commerce , successor to the Automobile Board of Trade . Hanch was treasurer of the Nordyke & Marmon Company , an Indianapolis firm which had manufactured flour-milling machinery before producing the Marmon car in 1904 . He had first-hand knowledge of the patent wars which had driven about ninety per cent of the milling equipment makers out of business in the mid-1890's . Anxious to avoid a similar debacle in the motor car industry , Hanch went to Detroit in 1909 to enlist the support of leading A.L.A.M. members for an industry-wide patent-sharing plan . The breach created by the Selden patent doomed his proposal , but Hanch did not abandon his scheme . After the demise of the A.L.A.M. , the time was propitious for establishing such a pool . Most manufacturers were now disposed to heed a proposal for the formal interchange of patents . `` It is a much easier course to agree to let one another alone so far as ordinary patents are concerned '' , said a trade authority , `` than to continue the costly effort of straightening the tangle in the courts or seeking to reform the patent system , which appears to be getting into deeper confusion every day '' . With the other members of the patents committee -- Wilfred C. Leland , Howard E. Coffin , Windsor T. White , and W. H. Vandervoort -- Hanch drafted a cross-licensing agreement whose essential feature of royalty-free licensing was his own contribution . The plan was supported by Frederick P. Fish , counsel for the National Automobile Chamber of Commerce . It will be recalled that in his summation for the A.L.A.M. before Judge Hough , Fish had condemned patent litigation as the curse of the American industrial community . He was well aware that some inventors and their allies used their patents solely for nuisance value . `` My personal view is that not one patented invention in ten is worth making '' , he later told a Congressional committee . The eloquent persuasions of Fish guaranteed the adoption of the plan by the members of the automotive trade association . Drawn up in 1914 , the cross-licensing agreement became effective in 1915 . It remained in force for ten years and has been renewed at five-year intervals since 1925 . A little farther along the road you come to the Church of Santa Sabina , called the `` Pearl of the Aventine '' . Continue another hundred yards to the Piazza of the Knights of Malta . On the wall of this square there are delightful bas-reliefs of musical instruments . The massive gate of the Maltese villa affords one of the most extraordinary views in Rome . If you look through the keyhole , you will see an artistically landscaped garden with the white dome of St. Peter's framed in a long avenue of cropped laurel trees . Retrace your steps a few yards on the Via Di Santa Sabina and turn right on the Via Di S. Alessio , a street lined with stately homes . Oleanders , cypress , and palms in the spacious gardens add much color and beauty to this attractive residential section . Turn left a block or so before the street ends , and then turn right down the Via Di Santa Prisca to the Viale Aventino . Here you can pick up a taxi or public transport to return to the center of the city . The renaissance city to the piazza Navona and pantheon These two walks take you through the heart of Rome . You will walk some of the narrow , old streets , hemmed in by massive palazzi . You will visit a few churches that are exceptional yet often by-passed , a magnificent square , the main shopping district , the Spanish Steps , and the lovely Pincian Gardens . By seeing such varied places , both interesting and beautiful , you will become aware of the many different civilizations Rome has lived through , and in particular , get a feel of Renaissance Rome . You will realize why Rome is indeed the Eternal City . Start on the Via D. Teatro Di Marcello at the foot of the Capitoline Hill . The majestic circular tiers of stone of the Theatre of Marcellus give you some idea of the huge edifice that the Emperor Augustus erected in 13 B.C. . Twenty-two thousand spectators used to crowd it in Roman days . Andrea Palladio , an Italian architect of the sixteenth century , modeled his designs on its Doric and Ionic columns . Wander past the three superb Columns of Apollo by the arches of the theatre . The remains of the Portico of Octavia are now in front of you . Climb the steps from the theatre to the Via Della Tribuna Di Campitelli for an even better view of the Columns of Apollo . Turn to the right along a narrow street to the tiny Piazza Campitelli , then proceed along the Via Dei Funari to the Piazza Mattei . Here is one of the loveliest fountains in Rome , the Fontana delle Tartarughe or `` Fountain of the Tortoises '' . It's typical of Rome that in the midst of this rather poor area you should find such an artistic work in the center of a little square . Stand here for a few moments and look at this gem of a fountain with its four youths , each holding a tortoise and each with a foot resting on the head of a dolphin . The figures have been executed so skillfully that one senses a great feeling of life and movement . Opposite is the Palazzo Mattei , one of Rome's oldest palaces , now the headquarters of the Italo-American Association . Go inside for a closer look at a Renaissance palace . In the first courtyard there are some fine bas-reliefs and friezes , and in the second a series of delightful terraced roof gardens above an ivy-covered wall . The Palazzo Caetani , still inhabited by the Caetani family , adjoins the Palazzo Mattei . Keep straight ahead on the Via Falegnami , cross the wide Via Arenula , and you will come to the Piazza B. Cairoli , where you should look in at the Church of San Carlo Ai Catinari to see the frescoes on the ceiling . Follow the colorful and busy Via D. Giubbonari for a hundred yards or so . Now turn left at the Via dell' Arco Del Monte to the Piazza Dei Pellegrini . Just a few yards to the right on the Via Capo Di Ferro will bring you to the Palazzo Spada , built in 1540 and now occupied by the Council of State . Paintings by Titian , Caravaggio , and Rubens are on display ( open 9:30 to 4:00 ) . Before you enter the palazzo , note Francesco Borromini's facade . The great architect also designed the fine interior staircase and colonnade which connects the two courts . The large statue on the first floor is believed to be the statue of Pompey at the base of which Julius Caesar was stabbed to death ( if so , the statue once stood in the senate house ) . ( This is shown in the afternoon and on Sunday morning . ) By tipping the porter , you can see in the courtyard Borromini's unusual and fascinating trick in perspective . When you stand before the barrel-vaulted colonnade you have the impression that the statue at the end is at a considerable distance , yet it is actually only a few feet away . The sense of perspective has been created by designing the length of the columns so that those at the far end of the colonnade are much shorter than those in front . The gardens of the palazzo , shaded by a huge magnolia tree , are most attractive . The courtyard is magnificently decorated . From the Palazzo Spada you continue another block along the Via Capo Di Ferro and Vicolo De Venti to the imposing Palazzo Farnese , begun in 1514 and considered by many to be the finest palace of all . Michelangelo was the most distinguished of several noted architects who helped design it . Today it is occupied by the French Embassy . Its lovely seventeenth-century ceiling frescoes , as well as the huge guards room with a tremendously high and beautifully carved wooden ceiling , can be seen Sundays ( 11:00 to 12:00 noon ) . Ask to see the modern tapestries of Paris and Rome designed by Lurcat . Directly in front of the palace along the Via D. Baullari you will come to the Campo Di Fiori , the famous site of executions during the turbulent days of Renaissance Rome . Today , by contrast it is a lively and colorful fruit , vegetable , and flower market . Continue on the Via D. Baullari to the Corso Vittorio Emanuele , then turn right for a couple of hundred yards to the Church of Sant' Andrea Della Valle . As you approach the church on the Via D. Baullari you are passing within yards of the remains of the Roman Theatre of Pompey , near which is believed to have been the place where Julius Caesar was assassinated . The dome of the church is , outside of St. Peter's , one of the largest in Rome . Opera lovers will be interested to learn that this church was the scene for the first act of Tosca . At this point you cross the wide Corso Vittorio Emanuele 2 , , walk along the Corso Del Rinascimento a couple of hundred yards , then turn left on the Via Dei Canestrani to enter the splendid Piazza Navona , one of the truly glorious sights in Rome . Your first impression of this elongated square with its three elegant fountains , its two churches that almost face each other , and its russet-colored buildings , is a sense of restful spaciousness -- particularly welcome after wandering around the narrow and dark streets that you have followed since starting this walk . The site of the oblong piazza is Domitian's ancient stadium , which was probably used for horse and chariot races . For centuries it was the location of historic festivals and open-air sports events . From the seventeenth to the nineteenth century it was a popular practice to flood the piazza in the summer , and the aristocrats would then ride around the inundated square in their carriages . Giovanni Bernini's `` Fountain of the Rivers '' , in the center of the piazza , is built around a Roman obelisk from the Circus of Maxentius which rests on grottoes and rocks , with four huge figures , one at each corner , denoting four great rivers from different continents -- the Danube , the Ganges , the Nile , and the Plate . The eyes of the figure of the Nile are covered , perhaps either to symbolize the mystery of her source or to obscure from her sight the baroque facade of the Church of Sant' Agnese in Agone , the work of Bernini's rival , Borromini . In the Piazza Navona there are many delightful cafes where you can sit , have a drink or lunch , and watch the fountains in the square . The scene before you is indeed theatrical and often appears in movies about Rome . Perhaps a street musician will pass to add that extra touch . Take the Via Di S. Agnese in Agone , next to the church and opposite the center of the square , then turn right after about two hundred yards to reach the beautiful Church of Santa Maria Della Pace . Inside you will find the lovely Sibyls painted by Raphael and a chapel designed by Michelangelo . The church's cloisters are among Donato Bramante's most beautiful creations . Now return to the Piazza Navona and leave it on the opposite side by the Corsia Agonale ; ; in a moment cross the Corso Del Rinascimento . In front of you is the Palazzo Madama , once belonging to the Medici and now the Italian Senate . Walk by the side of the palazzo and after two blocks along the Via Giustiniani you will come to the Piazza Della Rotonda . You are now facing the Pantheon , the largest and best-preserved building still standing from the days of ancient Rome . This circular edifice , constructed by Agrippa in B.C. 27 , was rebuilt in its present shape by the Emperor Hadrian . It was dedicated as a church in the seventh century . As you pause in the piazza by the Egyptian obelisk brought from the Temple of Isis , you will admire the Pantheon's impressive Corinthian columns . The Pantheon's interior , still in its original form , is truly majestic and an architectural triumph . Its rotunda forms a perfect circle whose diameter is equal to the height from the floor to the ceiling . The only means of interior light is the twenty-nine-foot-wide aperture in the stupendous dome . Standing before the tomb of Raphael , the great genius of the Renaissance , when shafts of sunlight are penetrating this great Roman temple , you are once again reminded of the varied civilizations so characteristic of Rome . As you leave the Pantheon , take the narrow street to the right , the Via Del Seminario , a block to Sant' Ignazio , one of the most splendid baroque churches in the city . ( Along the way there , about one hundred yards on your right , you pass a simple restaurant , La Sacrestia , where you can have the best pizza in Rome . ) The curve of faded terra-cotta-colored houses in front of the church seems like a stage set . This is one of the most charming little squares in this part of Rome . One block along the Via De Burro ( in front of the church ) will bring you to the Stock Exchange in the old Temple of Neptune . A few yards farther , on the Via Dei Bergamaschi , is the Piazza Colonna . The great column from which the square takes its name was erected by the Emperor Marcus Aurelius . You are now at the Corso , though narrow , one of Rome's busiest streets . Horse races took place here in the Middle Ages . If you have taken this stroll in the morning , and you have the time and inclination , walk to the right along the crowded Corso for half a dozen blocks to visit the fine private collection of paintings -- mainly of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries -- in the Palazzo Doria ( open Sunday , Tuesday , and Thursday , 10:00 to 1:00 ) . Here is your opportunity to see the inside of a palazzo where the family still lives . Otherwise , cross over the Corso and walk a block or so to the left . You will come to Alemagna , a delightful , though moderately expensive restaurant , which is particularly noted for its exceptional selection of ice creams and patisseries . Either here , or in one of the modest restaurants nearby , is just the place to end this first walk through the heart of Rome . To the Spanish steps The second walk through the heart of Rome should be taken after lunch , so that you will reach the Pincian Hill when the soft light of the late afternoon is at its best . Rare , indeed , is the Harlem citizen , from the most circumspect church member to the most shiftless adolescent , who does not have a long tale to tell of police incompetence , injustice , or brutality . I myself have witnessed and endured it more than once . The businessmen and racketeers also have a story . And so do the prostitutes . ( And this is not , perhaps , the place to discuss Harlem's very complex attitude toward black policemen , nor the reasons , according to Harlem , that they are nearly all downtown . ) It is hard , on the other hand , to blame the policeman , blank , good-natured , thoughtless , and insuperably innocent , for being such a perfect representative of the people he serves . He , too , believes in good intentions and is astounded and offended when they are not taken for the deed . He has never , himself , done anything for which to be hated -- which of us has ? -- and yet he is facing , daily and nightly , people who would gladly see him dead , and he knows it . There is no way for him not to know it : there are few things under heaven more unnerving than the silent , accumulating contempt and hatred of a people . He moves through Harlem , therefore , like an occupying soldier in a bitterly hostile country ; ; which is precisely what , and where , he is , and is the reason he walks in twos and threes . And he is not the only one who knows why he is always in company : the people who are watching him know why , too . Any street meeting , sacred or secular , which he and his colleagues uneasily cover has as its explicit or implicit burden the cruelty and injustice of the white domination . And these days , of course , in terms increasingly vivid and jubilant , it speaks of the end of that domination . The white policeman standing on a Harlem street corner finds himself at the very center of the revolution now occurring in the world . He is not prepared for it -- naturally , nobody is -- and , what is possibly much more to the point , he is exposed , as few white people are , to the anguish of the black people around him . Even if he is gifted with the merest mustard grain of imagination , something must seep in . He cannot avoid observing that some of the children , in spite of their color , remind him of children he has known and loved , perhaps even of his own children . He knows that he certainly does not want his children living this way . He can retreat from his uneasiness in only one direction : into a callousness which very shortly becomes second nature . He becomes more callous , the population becomes more hostile , the situation grows more tense , and the police force is increased . One day , to everyone's astonishment , someone drops a match in the powder keg and everything blows up . Before the dust has settled or the blood congealed , editorials , speeches , and civil-rights commissions are loud in the land , demanding to know what happened . What happened is that Negroes want to be treated like men . Negroes want to be treated like men : a perfectly straightforward statement , containing only seven words . People who have mastered Kant , Hegel , Shakespeare , Marx , Freud , and the Bible find this statement utterly impenetrable . The idea seems to threaten profound , barely conscious assumptions . A kind of panic paralyzes their features , as though they found themselves trapped on the edge of a steep place . I once tried to describe to a very well-known American intellectual the conditions among Negroes in the South . My recital disturbed him and made him indignant ; ; and he asked me in perfect innocence , `` Why don't all the Negroes in the South move North '' ? I tried to explain what has happened , unfailingly , whenever a significant body of Negroes move North . They do not escape Jim Crow : they merely encounter another , not-less-deadly variety . They do not move to Chicago , they move to the South Side ; ; they do not move to New York , they move to Harlem . The pressure within the ghetto causes the ghetto walls to expand , and this expansion is always violent . White people hold the line as long as they can , and in as many ways as they can , from verbal intimidation to physical violence . But inevitably the border which has divided the ghetto from the rest of the world falls into the hands of the ghetto . The white people fall back bitterly before the black horde ; ; the landlords make a tidy profit by raising the rent , chopping up the rooms , and all but dispensing with the upkeep ; ; and what has once been a neighborhood turns into a `` turf '' . This is precisely what happened when the Puerto Ricans arrived in their thousands -- and the bitterness thus caused is , as I write , being fought out all up and down those streets . Northerners indulge in an extremely dangerous luxury . They seem to feel that because they fought on the right side during the Civil War , and won , they have earned the right merely to deplore what is going on in the South , without taking any responsibility for it ; ; and that they can ignore what is happening in Northern cities because what is happening in Little Rock or Birmingham is worse . Well , in the first place , it is not possible for anyone who has not endured both to know which is `` worse '' . I know Negroes who prefer the South and white Southerners , because `` At least there , you haven't got to play any guessing games '' ! The guessing games referred to have driven more than one Negro into the narcotics ward , the madhouse , or the river . I know another Negro , a man very dear to me , who says , with conviction and with truth , `` The spirit of the South is the spirit of America '' . He was born in the North and did his military training in the South . He did not , as far as I can gather , find the South `` worse '' ; ; he found it , if anything , all too familiar . In the second place , though , even if Birmingham is worse , no doubt Johannesburg , South Africa , beats it by several miles , and Buchenwald was one of the worst things that ever happened in the entire history of the world . The world has never lacked for horrifying examples ; ; but I do not believe that these examples are meant to be used as justification for our own crimes . This perpetual justification empties the heart of all human feeling . The emptier our hearts become , the greater will be our crimes . Thirdly , the South is not merely an embarrassingly backward region , but a part of this country , and what happens there concerns every one of us . As far as the color problem is concerned , there is but one great difference between the Southern white and the Northerner : the Southerner remembers , historically and in his own psyche , a kind of Eden in which he loved black people and they loved him . Historically , the flaming sword laid across this Eden is the Civil War . Personally , it is the Southerner's sexual coming of age , when , without any warning , unbreakable taboos are set up between himself and his past . Everything , thereafter , is permitted him except the love he remembers and has never ceased to need . The resulting , indescribable torment affects every Southern mind and is the basis of the Southern hysteria . None of this is true for the Northerner . Negroes represent nothing to him personally , except , perhaps , the dangers of carnality . He never sees Negroes . Southerners see them all the time . Northerners never think about them whereas Southerners are never really thinking of anything else . Negroes are , therefore , ignored in the North and are under surveillance in the South , and suffer hideously in both places . Neither the Southerner nor the Northerner is able to look on the Negro simply as a man . It seems to be indispensable to the national self-esteem that the Negro be considered either as a kind of ward ( in which case we are told how many Negroes , comparatively , bought Cadillacs last year and how few , comparatively , were lynched ) , or as a victim ( in which case we are promised that he will never vote in our assemblies or go to school with our kids ) . They are two sides of the same coin and the South will not change -- cannot change -- until the North changes . The country will not change until it re-examines itself and discovers what it really means by freedom . In the meantime , generations keep being born , bitterness is increased by incompetence , pride , and folly , and the world shrinks around us . It is a terrible , an inexorable , law that one cannot deny the humanity of another without diminishing one's own : in the face of one's victim , one sees oneself . Walk through the streets of Harlem and see what we , this nation , have become . 4 . East River , downtown : postscript to a letter from Harlem the fact that American Negroes rioted in the U.N. while Adlai Stevenson was addressing the Assembly shocked and baffled most white Americans . Stevenson's speech , and the spectacular disturbance in the gallery , were both touched off by the death , in Katanga , the day before , of Patrice Lumumba . Stevenson stated , in the course of his address , that the United States was `` against '' colonialism . God knows what the African nations , who hold 25 per cent of the voting stock in the U.N. were thinking -- they may , for example , have been thinking of the U.S. abstention when the vote on Algerian freedom was before the Assembly -- but I think I have a fairly accurate notion of what the Negroes in the gallery were thinking . I had intended to be there myself . It was my first reaction upon hearing of Lumumba's death . I was curious about the impact of this political assassination on Negroes in Harlem , for Lumumba had -- has -- captured the popular imagination there . I was curious to know if Lumumba's death , which is surely among the most sinister of recent events , would elicit from `` our '' side anything more than the usual , well-meaning rhetoric . And I was curious about the African reaction . However , the chaos on my desk prevented my being in the U.N. gallery . Had I been there , I , too , in the eyes of most Americans , would have been merely a pawn in the hands of the Communists . The climate and the events of the last decade , and the steady pressure of the `` cold '' war , have given Americans yet another means of avoiding self-examination , and so it has been decided that the riots were `` Communist '' inspired . Nor was it long , naturally , before prominent Negroes rushed forward to assure the republic that the U.N. rioters do not represent the real feeling of the Negro community . According , then , to what I take to be the prevailing view , these rioters were merely a handful of irresponsible , Stalinist-corrupted provocateurs . I find this view amazing . It is a view which even a minimal effort at observation would immediately contradict . One has only , for example , to walk through Harlem and ask oneself two questions . The first question is : Would I like to live here ? And the second question is : Why don't those who now live here move out ? The answer to both questions is immediately obvious . Unless one takes refuge in the theory -- however disguised -- that Negroes are , somehow , different from white people , I do not see how one can escape the conclusion that the Negro's status in this country is not only a cruel injustice but a grave national liability . Now , I do not doubt that , among the people at the U.N. that day , there were Stalinist and professional revolutionists acting out of the most cynical motives . Wherever there is great social discontent , these people are , sooner or later , to be found . Their presence is not as frightening as the discontent which creates their opportunity . What I find appalling -- and really dangerous -- is the American assumption that the Negro is so contented with his lot here that only the cynical agents of a foreign power can rouse him to protest . It is a notion which contains a gratuitous insult , implying , as it does , that Negroes can make no move unless they are manipulated . Color was delayed until 1935 , the wide screen until the early fifties . Movement itself was the chief and often the only attraction of the primitive movies of the nineties . Each film consisted of fifty feet , which gives a running time of about one minute on the screen . As long as audiences came to see the movement , there seemed little reason to adventure further . Motion-picture exhibitions took place in stores in a general atmosphere like that of the penny arcade which can still be found in such urban areas as Times Square . Brief snips of actual events were shown : parades , dances , street scenes . The sensational and frightening enjoyed popularity : a train rushes straight at the audience , or a great wave threatens to break over the seats . An early Edison production was The Execution Of Mary , Queen Of Scots . The unfortunate queen mounted the scaffold ; ; the headsman swung his axe ; ; the head dropped off ; ; end of film . An early film by a competitor of the Wizard of Menlo Park simply showed a long kiss performed by two actors of the contemporary stage . In the field of entertainment there is no spur to financial daring so effective as audience boredom , and the first decade of the new device was not over before audiences began staying away in large numbers from the simple-minded , one-minute shows . In response , the industry allowed the discovery of the motion picture as a form of fiction and thus gave the movies the essential form they have had to this day . Despite the sheer beauty and spectacle of numerous documentaries , art films , and travelogues , despite the impressive financial success of such a recent development as Cinerama , the movies are at heart a form of fiction , like the play , the novel , or the short story . Moreover , the most artistically successful of the nonfiction films have invariably borrowed the narrative form from the fiction feature . Thus such great American documentaries as The River and The Plow That Broke The Plains were composed as visual stories rather than as illustrated lectures . The discovery that movies are a form of fiction was made in the early years of this century and it was made chiefly by two men , a French magician , Georges Melies , and an American employee of Edison , Edwin S. Porter . Of the two , Porter is justly the better known , for he went far beyond the vital finding of fiction for films to take the first step toward fashioning a language of film , toward making the motion picture the intricate , efficient time machine that it has remained since , even in the most inept hands . Narrative time and film time Melies , however , out of his professional instincts as a magician , discovered and made use of a number of illusionary techniques that remain part of the vocabulary of film . One of these is the `` dissolve '' , which makes possible a visually smooth transition from scene to scene . As the first scene begins to fade , the succeeding scene begins to appear . For a moment or two , both scenes are present simultaneously , one growing weaker , one growing stronger . In a series of fairy tales and fantasies , Melies demonstrated that the film is superbly equipped to tell a straightforward story , with beginning , middle and end , complications , resolutions , climaxes , and conclusions . Immediately , the film improved and it improved because in narrative it found a content based on time to complement its own unbreakable connection with time . Physically , a movie is possible because a series of images is projected one at a time at such a speed that the eye `` remembers '' the one that has gone before even as it registers the one now appearing . Linking the smoothly changing images together , the eye itself endows them with the illusion of movement . The `` projection '' time of painting and sculpture is highly subjective , varying from person to person and even varying for a given person on different occasions . So is the time of the novel . The drama in the theater and the concert in the hall both have a fixed time , but the time is fixed by the director and the players , the conductor and the instrumentalists , subject , therefore , to much variation , as record collectors well know . The time of the motion picture is fixed absolutely . The film consists of a series of still , transparent photographs , or `` frames '' , 35-mm.-wide . Each frame comes between the light and the lens and is individually projected on the screen , at the rate , for silent movies , of 16 frames per second , and , for sound films , 24 frames per second . This is the rate of projection ; ; it is also the rate of photographing . Time is built into the motion picture , which cannot exist without time . Now time is also the concern of the fictional narrative , which is , at its simplest , the story of an action with , usually , a beginning , a middle , and an end -- elements which demand time as the first condition for their existence . The `` moving '' picture of the train or the wave coming at the audience is , to be sure , more intense than a still picture of the same subject , but the difference is really one of degree ; ; the cinematic element of time is merely used to increase the realism of an object which would still be reasonably realistic in a still photo . In narrative , time is essential , as it is in film . Almost everything about the movies that is peculiarly of the movies derives from a tension created and maintained between narrative time and film time . This discovery of Melies was vastly more important than his sometimes dazzling , magician's tricks produced on film . It was Porter , however , who produced the very first movie whose name has lived on through the half century of film history that has since ensued . The movie was The Great Train Robbery and its effects on the young industry and art were all but incalculable . Overnight , for one thing , Porter's film multiplied the standard running time of movies by ten . The Great Train Robbery is a one-reel film . One reel -- from eight to twelve minutes -- became the standard length from the year of Robbery , 1903 , until Griffith shattered that limit forever with Birth Of A Nation in 1915 . The reel itself became and still is the standard of measure for the movies . The material of the Porter film is simplicity itself ; ; much of it has continued to be used over the years and the heart of it -- good guys and bad guys in the old West -- pretty well dominated television toward the end of the 1950's . A band of robbers enters a railroad station , overpowers and ties up the telegraph operator , holds up the train and escapes . A posse is formed and pursues the robbers , who , having made their escape , are whooping it up with some wild , wild women in a honky-tonk hide-out . The robbers run from the hide-out , take cover in a wooded declivity , and are shot dead by the posse . As a finale is appended a close-up of one of the band taking aim and firing his revolver straight at the audience . All this is simple enough , but in telling the story Porter did two important things that had not been done before . Each scene is shot straight through , as had been the universal custom , from a camera fixed in a single position , but in the outdoor scenes , especially in the capture and destruction of the outlaws , Porter's camera position breaks , necessarily , with the camera position standard until then , which had been , roughly , that of a spectator in a center orchestra seat at a play . The plane of the action in the scene is not parallel with the plane of the film in the camera or on the screen . If the change , at first sight , seems minor , we may recall that it took the Italian painters about two hundred years to make an analogous change , and the Italian painters , by universal consent , were the most brilliant group of geniuses any art has seen . In that apparently simple shift Porter opened the way to the sensitive use of the camera as an instrument of art as well as a mechanical recording device . He did more than that . He revealed the potential value of the `` cut '' as the basic technique in the art of the film . Cutting , of course , takes place automatically in the creation of a film . The meaning of the word is quite physical , to begin with . The physical film is cut with a knife at the end of one complete sequence , and the cut edge is joined physically , by cement , to the cut edge of the beginning of the next sequence . If , as a home movie maker , you shoot the inevitable footage of your child taking its first steps , you have merely recorded an historical event . If , in preparing that shot for the inevitable showing to your friends , you interrupt the sequence to paste in a few frames of the child's grandmother watching this event , you have begun to be an artist in film ; ; you are employing the basic technique of film ; ; you are cutting . This is what Porter did . As the robbers leave the looted train , the film suddenly cuts back to the station , where the telegrapher's little daughter arrives with her father's dinner pail only to find him bound on the floor . She dashes around in alarm . The two events are taking place at the same time . Time and space have both become cinematic . We leap from event to event -- including the formation of the posse -- even though the events , in `` reality '' are taking place not in sequence but simultaneously , and not near each other but at a considerable distance . The `` chase '' as a standard film device probably dates from The Great Train Robbery , and there is a reason for the continued popularity of the device . The chase in itself is a narrative ; ; it presumes both speed and urgency and it demands cutting -- both from pursued to pursuer and from stage to stage of the journey of both . The simple , naked idea of one man chasing another is of its nature better fitted for the film than it is for any other form of fiction . The cowboy films , the cops and robbers films , and the slapstick comedy films culminating in an insane chase are not only catering to what critics may assume to be a vulgar taste for violence ; ; these films and these sequences are also seeking out -- instinctively or by design -- the peculiarly cinematic elements of narrative . The creator of the art of the film : D.W. Griffith There still remained the need for one great film artist to explore the full potential of the new form and to make it an art . The man was D.W. Griffith . When he came to the movies -- more or less by accident -- they were still cheap entertainment capable of enthralling the unthinking for an idle few minutes . In about seven years Griffith either invented or first realized the possibilities of virtually every resource at the disposal of the film maker . Before he was forty Griffith had created the art of the film . Not that there had not been attempts , mostly European , to do exactly that . But in general the European efforts to make an art of the entertainment had ignored the slowly emerging language of the film itself . Staggeringly condensed versions of famous novels and famous plays were presented . Great actors and actresses -- the most notable being Sarah Bernhardt -- were hired to repeat their stage performances before the camera . In all of this extensive and expensive effort , the camera was downgraded to the status of recording instrument for art work produced elsewhere by the actor or by the author . The phonograph today , for all its high fidelity and stereophonic sound , is precisely what the early art purveyors in the movies wished to make of the camera . Not surprisingly , this approach did not work . The effort produced a valuable record of stage techniques in the early years of the century and some interesting records of great theater figures who would otherwise be only names . But no art at all was born of the art effort in the early movies . In general , religious interest seems to exist in all parts of the metropolis ; ; congregational membership , however , is another thing . A congregation survives only if it can sustain a socially homogeneous membership ; ; that is , when it can preserve economic integration . Religious faith can be considered a necessary condition of membership in a congregation , since the decision to join a worshiping group requires some motive force , but faith is not a sufficient condition for joining ; ; the presence of other members of similar social and economic level is the sufficient condition . The breakdown of social homogeneity in inner city areas and the spread of inner city blight account for the decline of central city churches . Central cities reveal two adverse features for the major denominations : ( 1 ) central cities tend to be areas of residence for lower social classes ; ; ( 2 ) central cities tend to be more heterogeneous in social composition . The central city areas , in other words , exhibit the two characteristics which violate the life principle of congregations of the major denominations : they have too few middle-class people ; ; they mix middle-class people with lower-class residents . Central city areas have become progressively poorer locales for the major denominations since the exodus of middle-class people from most central cities . With few exceptions , the major denominations are rapidly losing their hold on the central city . The key to Protestant development , therefore , is economic integration of the nucleus of the congregation . Members of higher and lower social status often cluster around this nucleus , so that Protestant figures on social class give the impression of spread over all social classes ; ; but this is deceptive , for the core of membership is concentrated in a single social and economic stratum . The congregation perishes when it is no longer possible to replenish that core from the neighborhood ; ; moreover , residential mobility is so high in metropolitan areas that churches have to recruit constantly in their core stratum in order to survive ; ; they can lose higher- and lower-status members from the church without collapsing , but they need adequate recruits for the core stratum in order to preserve economic integration . The congregation is first and foremost an economic peer group ; ; it is secondarily a believing and worshiping fellowship . If it were primarily a believing fellowship , it would recruit believers from all social and economic ranks , something which most congregations of the New Protestantism ( with a few notable exceptions ) have not been able to do . They survive only when they can recruit social and economic peers . The vulnerability of Protestant congregations to social differences has often been attributed to the `` folksy spirit '' of Protestant religious life ; ; in fact , a contrast is often drawn in this regard with the `` impersonal '' Roman Catholic parish . We have seen that the folksy spirit is confined to economic peers ; ; consequently , the vulnerability to social difference should not be attributed to the stress on personal community in Protestant congregations ; ; actually , there is little evidence of such personal community in Protestant congregations , as we shall see in another connection . The vulnerability of Protestantism to social differences stems from the peculiar role of the new religious style in middle-class life , where the congregation is a vehicle of social and economic group identity and must conform , therefore , to the principle of economic integration . This fact is evident in the recruitment of new members . Mission as co-optation The rule of economic integration in congregational life can be seen in the missionary outreach of the major denominations . There is much talk in theological circles about the `` Church as Mission '' and the `` Church's Mission '' ; ; theologians have been stressing the fact that the Church does not exist for its own sake but as a testimony in the world for the healing of the world . A crucial question , therefore , is what evangelism and mission actually mean in metropolitan Protestantism . If economic integration really shapes congregational life , then evangelism should be a process of extending economic integration . The task of a congregation would be defined , according to economic integration , as the work of co-opting individuals and families of similar social and economic position to replenish the nuclear core of the congregation . ( Co-optation means to choose by joint action in order to fill a vacancy ; ; it can also mean the assimilation of centers of power from an environment in order to strengthen an organization . ) In a mobile society , congregational health depends on a constant process of recruitment ; ; this recruitment , however , must follow the pattern of economic integration or it will disrupt the congregation ; ; therefore , the recruitment or missionary outreach of the congregation will be co-optation rather than proclamation -- like elements will have to be assimilated . Evangelism and congregational outreach have not been carefully studied in the churches ; ; one study in Pittsburgh , however , has illuminated the situation . In a sample of new members of Pittsburgh churches , almost 60 per cent were recruited by initial `` contacts with friendly members '' . If we add to these contacts with friendly members the `` contacts with an organization of the church '' ( 11.2 per cent of the cases ) , then a substantial two thirds of all recruitment is through friendly contact . On the surface , this seems a sound approach to Christian mission : members of the congregation show by their friendly attitudes that they care for new people ; ; the new people respond in kind by joining the church . Missionary outreach by friendly contact looks somewhat different when one reflects on what is known about friendly contact in metropolitan neighborhoods ; ; the majority of such contacts are with people of similar social and economic position ; ; association by level of achievement is the dominant principle of informal relations . This means that the antennae of the congregation are extended into the community , picking up the wave lengths of those who will fit into the social and economic level of the congregation ; ; the mission of the church is actually a process of informal co-optation ; ; the lay ministry is a means to recruit like-minded people who will strengthen the social class nucleus of the congregation . Churches can be strengthened through this process of co-optation so long as the environs of the church provide a sufficient pool of people who can fit the pattern of economic integration ; ; once the pool of recruits diminishes , the congregation is helpless -- friendly contacts no longer keep it going . The transmutation of mission to co-optation is further indicated by the insignificance of educational activities , worship , preaching , and publicity in reaching new members . The proclamation of the churches is almost totally confined to pastoral contacts by the clergy ( 17.3 per cent of new members ) and friendly contacts by members ( over two thirds if organizational activities are included ) . Publicity accounted for 1.1 per cent of the initial contacts with new members . In general , friendly contact with a member followed by contact with a clergyman will account for a major share of recruitment by the churches , making it quite evident that the extension of economic integration through co-optation is the principal form of mission in the contemporary church ; ; economic integration and co-optation are the two methods by which Protestants associate with and recruit from the neighborhood . The inner life of congregations will prosper so long as like-minded people of similar social and economic level can fraternize together ; ; the outer life of congregations -- the suitability of the environment to their survival -- will be propitious so long as the people in the area are of the same social and economic level as the membership . Economic integration ceases when the social and economic statuses in an area become too mixed or conflict with the status of the congregation . In a rapidly changing society congregations will run into difficulties repeatedly , since such nice balances of economic integration are hard to sustain in the metropolis for more than a single generation . The fact that metropolitan churches of the major denominations have moved approximately every generation for the last hundred years becomes somewhat more intelligible in the light of this struggle to maintain economic balance . The expense of this type of organization in religious life , when one recalls the number of city churches which deteriorated beyond repair before being abandoned , raises fundamental questions about the principle of Protestant survival in a mobile society ; ; nonetheless , the prevalence of economic integration in congregations illumines the nature of the Protestant development . It was observed in the introductory chapter that metropolitan life had split into two trends -- expanding interdependence on an impersonal basis and growing exclusiveness in local communal groupings . These trends seem to be working at cross-purposes in the metropolis . Residential associations struggle to insulate themselves against intrusions . The motifs of impersonal interdependence and insulation of residential communities have polarized ; ; the schism between central city and suburb , Negro and White , blue collar and white collar can be viewed as symptomatic of this deeper polarization of trends in the metropolis . It now becomes evident that the denominational church is intimately involved with the economy of middle-class culture , for it serves to crystallize the social class identity of middle-class residential groupings . The accelerated pace of metropolitan changes has accentuated the drive to conformity in congregations of the major denominations . This conformity represents a desperate attempt to stabilize a hopelessly unstable environment . More than creatures of metropolitan forces , the churches have taken the lead in counteracting the interdependence of metropolitan life , crystallizing and perpetuating the stratification of peoples , giving form to the struggle for social homogeneity in a world of heterogeneous peoples . Since American life is committed above all to productivity and a higher standard of economic life , the countervailing forces of residential and religious exclusiveness have fought a desperate , rearguard action against the expanding interdependence of the metropolis . Consumer communities have suffered at the hands of the productive interests . Negroes , Puerto Ricans , and rural newcomers are slowly making their way into the cities . Soon they will fight their way into the lower middle-class suburbs , and the churches will experience the same decay and rebuilding cycle which has characterized their history for a century . The identification of the basic unit of religious organization -- the parish or congregation -- with a residential area is self-defeating in a modern metropolis , for it simply means the closing of an iron trap on the outreach of the Christian fellowship and the transmutation of mission to co-optation . Mission to the metropolis contradicts survival of the congregation in the residential community , because the middle classes are fighting metropolitan interdependence with residential exclusion . This interpretation of the role of residence in the economy of middle-class culture could lead to various projections for the churches . It could be argued that any fellowship which centers in residential neighborhoods is doomed to become an expression of the panic for stable identity among the middle classes . It could be argued that only such neighborhoods can sustain religious activity , since worship presupposes some local stabilities . Whatever projection one makes , the striking fact about congregational and parochial life is the extent to which it is a vehicle of the social identity of middle-class people . Attention will be given in the next chapter to the style of association in the denominational churches ; ; this style is characteristically an expression of the communal style of the middle classes . The keynotes of this style are activism and emphasis on achievements in gaining self-esteem . These values give direction to the life of the middle-class man or woman , dictating the methods of child rearing , determining the pattern of community participation , setting the style for the psychiatric treatment of middle-class illness , and informing the congregational life of the major denominations . `` Fellowship by likeness '' and `` mission by friendly contact '' form the iron cage of denominational religion . Its contents are another matter , for they reveal the kinds of interests pursued by the congregation . What goes on in the cage will occupy our attention under the rubric of the organization church . An understanding of the new role of residential association in an industrial society serves to illuminate the forces which have fashioned the iron cage of conformity which imprisons the churches in their suburban captivity . The perplexing question still remains as to why the middle classes turn to the churches as a vehicle of social identity when their clubs and charities should fill the same need . With capital largely squandered , there seemed to them no other course to pursue . The directors sold directly to concessionaires , who had to make their profits above the high prices asked by the company . These concessionaires traded where they wished and generally dealt with the Indians through engages , who might be habitants , voyageurs , or even soldiers . The concessionaires also had to pay a tax of one-tenth on the goods they traded , and all pelts were to be taken to company stores and shipped to France in company ships . The company disposed of the pelts , but with what profit , the records do not show . In accord with its penurious policy , the company failed to furnish presents to hold the loyalty of the principal Indians . The lavish use of presents had been effective in expanding the Indian trade of New France and Louisiana in the previous century , and the change in liberality aroused resentment in the minds of the red men . Traders from the English colonies were far more generous , and Indian loyalty turned to them . Protests from governors and intendants passed unheeded , and the parsimonious policy of the company probably let loose Indian insurrections that brought ruin to the company . In 1721 the King sent three commissioners to Louisiana with full powers to do all that was necessary to protect the colony . They ordered the raising of troops and obtained 75,000 livres with which to build forts . They adopted a program by which Louisiana was divided into five districts . In each of these there was to be a strong military post , and a trading depot to supply the smaller trading houses . For southeastern Louisiana , Mobile was the principal post , and it was to furnish supplies for trade to the north and east , in the region threatened by British traders . Mobile was to be the anchor of a chain of posts extending northward to the sources of the Tennessee River . Fort Toulouse , on the Alabama River , had been erected in 1714 for trade with the Alabamas and Choctaws , but money was available for only one other new post , near the present Nashville , Tennessee , and this was soon abandoned . West of the Mobile district was the lower Mississippi district , of which New Orleans was headquarters . Dependent upon it were posts on the lower Mississippi and the region westward to the frontiers of New Spain . On the middle Mississippi a principal post was to be located near the mouth of the Arkansas . It was hoped that to this post would flow a large quantity of furs from the west , principally down the Arkansas River . On the Ohio or Wabash was to be built another post `` at the fork of two great rivers '' . Other posts would be established up the Ohio and Wabash to protect communication with Canada . On the upper Mississippi the Illinois post was to be established near Kaskaskia , and dependent posts were to be built on the Missouri , `` where there are mines in abundance '' . Each of the five principal posts was to have a director , responsible to a director-general at New Orleans . An elaborate system of accounting and reports was worked out , and the trade was to be managed in the most scientific way . Concessionaires were to be under the supervision of the directors . Engages must be loyal to the concessionaires , and must serve until the term provided in the engagement was ended . The habitants were to be encouraged to trade and were to dispose of their pelts to the concessionaires . Only two principal storehouses were actually established -- one at Mobile , the other at New Orleans . New Orleans supplied the goods for the trade on the Mississippi , and west of that river , and on the Ohio and Wabash . Mobile was also supplied by New Orleans with goods for the Mobile district . The power that Bienville exercised during his first administration cannot be determined . Regulations for the Indian trade were made by the Conseil superieure de la Louisiane , and Bienville apparently did not have control of that body . The Conseil even treated the serious matter of British aggression as its business and , on its own authority , sent to disaffected savages merchandise `` suitable for the peltry trade '' . It decided , also , that the purely secular efforts of Bienville were insufficient , and sent missionaries to win the savages from the heathen Carolinians . During the first administration of Bienville , the peltry trade of the Mobile district was a lucrative source of revenue . The Alabamas brought in annually 15,000 to 20,000 deerskins , and the Choctaws and Chickasaws brought the total up to 50,000 pelts . These deerskins were the raw material for the manufacture of leather , and were the only articles which the tribes of this district had to exchange for European goods . During his first administration , Bienville succeeded in keeping Carolina traders out of the Alabama country and the Choctaw country . The director of the post at Mobile kept an adequate amount of French goods , of a kind to which they were accustomed , to supply the Indian needs . The Alabama and Tombigbee rivers furnished a highway by which goods could be moved quickly and cheaply . De La Laude , commander of the Alabama post , had the friendship of the natives , and was able to make them look upon the British as poor competitors . Diron D'Artaguette , the most prominent trader in the district , was energetic and resourceful , but his methods often aroused the ire of the French governors . He became , after a time , commander of a post on the Alabama River , but his operations extended from Mobile throughout the district , and he finally obtained a monopoly of the Indian trade . The Chickasaws were the principal source of trouble in the Mobile district . Their territory lay to the north , near the sources of the Alabama , the Tombigbee , the Tennessee , and Cumberland rivers , and was easily accessible to traders among the near-by Cherokees . In 1720 some Chickasaws massacred the French traders among them , and did not make peace for four years . Venturesome traders , however , continued to come to them from Mobile , and to obtain a considerable number of pelts for the French markets . British traders from South Carolina incited the Indians against the French , and there developed French and British Factions in the tribe . The Chickasaws finally were the occasion for the most disastrous wars during the French control of Louisiana . To hold them was an essential part of French policy , for they controlled the upper termini of the routes from the north to Mobile . They threatened constantly to give the British a hold on this region , from whence they could move easily down the rivers to the French settlements near the Gulf . Bienville realized that if the French were to hold the southeastern tribes against the enticements of British goods , French traders must be able to offer a supply as abundant as the Carolinians and at reasonable prices . His urgings brought some results . The Company of the Indies promised to send over a supply of Indian trading goods , and to price them more cheaply in terms of deerskins . But it coupled with this a requirement that Indians must bring their pelts to Mobile and thus save all costs of transportation into and out of the Indian country . The insistence of Bienville upon giving liberal prices to the Indians , in order to drive back the Carolina traders , was probably a factor that led to his recall in 1724 . For two years his friend and cousin , Boisbriant , remained as acting governor and could do little to stem the Anglican advance . Although he incited a few friendly Indians to pillage the invaders , and even kill some of them , the Carolina advance continued . The company was impressed with some ideas of the danger from Carolina , and when Perier came over as governor in 1727 , he was given special instructions regarding the trade of the Mobile district . But the Company of the Indies , holding to its program of economy , made no arrangements to furnish better goods at attractive prices . To the directors the problem appeared a matter of intrigue or diplomacy . Perier attempted to understand the problem by sending agents to inquire among the Indians . These agents were to ascertain the difference between English and French goods , and the prices charged the Indians . They were to conciliate the unfriendly savages , and , wherever possible , to incite the natives to pillage the traders from Carolina . They were to promise fine presents to the loyal red men , as well as an abundant supply of trading goods at better prices than the opposition was offering . Perier's intrigues gained some successes . The savages divided into two factions ; ; one was British and the other , French . So hostile did these factions become that , among the Choctaws , civil war broke out . Perier's efforts , however , were on the whole ineffective in winning back the tribes of the Mobile district , and he decided to send troops into the troubled country . He asked the government for two hundred soldiers , who were to be specifically assigned to arrest English traders and disloyal Indians . In spite of the company's restrictions , he planned to build new posts in the territory . He asked also for more supplies to trade at a low price for the Indians' pelts . No help came from the crown , and Perier , in desperation , gave a monopoly of the Indian trade in the district to D'Artaguette . D'Artaguette went vigorously to work , and gave credit to many hunters . But they brought back few pelts to pay their debts , and soon French trade in the region was at an end . Perier finally , in one last bid in 1730 , cut the price of goods to an advance of 40 per cent above the cost in France . The Indians were not impressed and held to the Carolina traders , who swarmed over the country , almost to the Mississippi . With the loss of the Mobile trade , which ended all profits from Louisiana , the Natchez Indians revolted . They destroyed a trading house and pillaged the goods , and harassed French shipping on the Mississippi . The war to subdue them taxed the resources of the colony and piled up enormous debts . In January , 1731 , the company asked the crown to relieve it of the government of the colony . It stated that it had lost 20,000,000 livres in its operations , and apparently blamed its poor success largely on the Indian trade . It offered to surrender its right to exclusive trade , but asked an indemnity . The King accepted the surrender and fixed the compensation of the company at 1,450,000 livres . Thenceforth , the commerce of Louisiana was free to all Frenchmen . Company rule in Louisiana left the colony without fortifications , arms , munitions , or supplies . The difficulties of trade had ruined many voyageurs , and numbers of them had gone to live with the natives and rear half-blood families . Others left the country , and there was no one familiar with the Indian trade . If this trade should be resumed , the habitants who had come to be farmers or artisans , and soldiers discharged from the army , must be hardened to the severe life of coureurs de bois . This was a slow and difficult course , and French trade suffered from the many mistakes of the new group of traders . These men were without capital or experience . Perier and Salmon , the intendant , wished either to entrust the trade to an association of merchants or to have the crown furnish goods on credit to individuals who would repay their debts with pelts . Bienville , who returned to succeed Perier in 1732 , objected that the merchants would not accept the responsibility of managing a trade in which they could see no hope of profits . He reported , too , that among the habitants there were none of probity and ability sufficient to justify entrusting them with the King's goods . He did find some to trust , however , and he employed the King's soldiers to trade . With no company to interfere , he kept close control over all the traders . In order to compete with English traders , Bienville radically changed the price schedule . The King should expect no profit , and an advance of only 20 per cent above the cost in France , which would cover the expense of transportation and handling , was all he charged the traders . They would not be pleased to have it published back home that they planned a frolic in Paris or Hong Kong at the Treasury's expense . They would be particularly displeased with the State Department if it were the source of such reports . Few things are more perilous for the State Department than a displeased congressman . The reason for this bears explaining for those who may wonder why State spends so much of its diplomatic energy on Congress when the Russians are so available . First , the State Department is unique among government agencies for its lack of public supporters . The farmers may be aroused if Congress cuts into the Agriculture Department's budget . Businessmen will rise if Congress attacks the Commerce Department . Labor restrains undue brutality toward the Labor Department ; ; the Chamber of Commerce , assaults upon the Treasury . A kaleidoscope of pressure groups make it unpleasant for the congressman who becomes ugly toward the Department of Health , Education , and Welfare . The congressman's patriotism is always involved when he turns upon the Defense Department . Tampering with the Post Office may infuriate every voter who can write . With all these agencies , the congressman must constantly check the political wind and trim his sails accordingly . No such political restraint subdues his blood when he gazes upon the State Department in anger . In many sections he may even reap applause from press and public for giving it a good lesson . After all , the money dispensed by State goes not to the farmer , the laborer , or the businessman , but to foreigners . Not only do these foreigners not vote for American congressmen ; ; they are also probably ungrateful for Uncle's Sam's bounty . And are not the State Department men who dispense this largesse merely crackpots and do-gooders who have never met a payroll ? Will not the righteous congressman be cheered at the polls if he reminds them to get right with America and if he saves the taxpayer some money by spoiling a few of their schemes ? The chances are excellent that he will . The result is that the State Department's perpetual position before Congress is the resigned pose of the whipping boy who expects to be kicked whenever the master has had a dyspeptic outing with his wife . People in this position do not offend the master by relating his peccadilloes to the newspapers . State keeps the junketeering list a secret . The Department expects and receives no thanks from Congress for its discretion . Congress is a harsh master . State is expected to arrange the touring Cicero's foreign itinerary ; ; its embassies are expected to supply him with reams of local money to pay his way ; ; embassy workers are expected to entertain him according to his whim , frequently with their savings for the children's college tuition . But come the next session of Congress , State can expect only that its summer guest will bite its hand when it goes to the Capitol asking money for diplomatic entertaining expenses abroad or for living expenses for its diplomats . The congressman who , in Paris , may have stuffed his wallet with enough franc notes to paper the roof of Notre-Dame will systematically scream that a $200 increase in entertainment allowance for a second secretary is tantamount to debauchery of the Treasury . In the matter of money State's most unrelenting watchdog during the Eisenhower years was Representative John J. Rooney , of Brooklyn , who controlled the purse for diplomatic administrative expenses . Diplomats stayed up nights thinking of ways to attain peaceful coexistence , not with Nikita Khrushchev , but with John Rooney . Nothing worked . In the most confidential whispers ambassadors told of techniques they had tried to bring Rooney around -- friendly persuasion , groveling abasement , pressure subtly exerted through other powerful congressmen , tales of heartbreak and penury among a threadbare diplomatic corps . Rooney remained untouched . `` The trouble , '' explained Loy Henderson , then Deputy Undersecretary for Administration , `` is that when we get into an argument with him about this thing , it always turns out that Rooney knows more about our budget than we do '' . One year the Department collected a file of case histories to document its argument that men in the field were paying the government's entertainment bills out of personal income . News of the project reached the press . Next day , reports went through the Department that Rooney had been outraged by what he considered a patent attempt to put public pressure on him for increased entertainment allowances and had sworn an oath that , that year , expense allowances would not rise a dollar . They didn't . The Department's constant fight with the House for money is a polite minuet compared with its periodic bloody engagements with the Senate . Armed with constitutional power to negate the Executive's foreign policy , the Senate carries a big stick and is easily provoked to use it on the State Department's back , or on the head of the Secretary of State . With its power to investigate , the Senate can paralyze the Secretary by keeping him in a state of perpetual testimony before committees , as it did with Dean Acheson . John Foster Dulles escaped by keeping his personal show on the road and because Lyndon Johnson , who was then operating the Senate , refused to let it become an Inquisition . During Dulles's first two years in office , while Republicans ran the Senate , the Department was at the mercy of men who had thirsted for its blood since 1945 . An internal police operation managed by Scott McLeod , a former F.B.I. man installed as security officer upon congressional insistence , was part of the vengeance . So was the attack upon Charles E. Bohlen when Eisenhower appointed him Ambassador to Moscow . The principal mauler , however , was Senator Joseph McCarthy . Where Acheson had fought a gallant losing battle for the Department , Dulles fed the crocodile with his subordinates . Fretting privately but eschewing public defense of his terrorized bureaucrats , Dulles remained serene and detached while the hatchet men had their way . In view of Eisenhower's reluctance to concede that anything was amiss in the Terror , it is doubtful that heroic intervention by Dulles could have produced anything but disaster for him and the country's foreign policy . In any event , the example of Acheson's trampling by the Senate did not encourage Dulles to provoke it . He elected to `` get along '' . During this dark chapter in State Department history , men who had offered foreign-policy ideas later proven wrong by events filled the tumbrels sent up to Capitol Hill . Their old errors of judgment were equated , in the curious logic of the time , with present treasonous intent . Their successors , absorbing the lesson , made it a point to have few ideas . This , in turn , brought a new fashion in senatorial criticism as the Democrats took control . In the new style , the Department was berated as intellectually barren and unable to produce the vital ideas needed to outwit the Russians . For three or four years in the mid-1950's , this complaint was heard rumbling up from the Senate floor whenever there was a dull legislative afternoon . It became smart to say that the fault was with Dulles because he would not countenance thinking done by anyone but himself . An equally tenable thesis is that the dearth of new thought was created by the Senate's own penchant for crucifying anyone whose ideas seem unorthodox to the next generation . Getting along with foreigners there are ninety-eight foreign embassies and legations in Washington . They range from the Soviet Embassy on Sixteenth Street , a gray shuttered pile suggesting a funeral-accessories display house , to what Congressman Rooney has called `` that monstrosity on Thirty-fourth Street '' , the modern cement-and-glass chancery of the Belgians . Here is the world of the chauffeured limousine and the gossip reporter , of caviar on stale crackers and the warm martini , of the poseur , the spy , the party crasher , and the patriot , of the rented tails , the double cross , and the tired Lothario . Into its chanceries each day pour reports from ministries around the earth and an endless stream of home-office instructions on how to handle Uncle Sam in an infinite variety of contingencies . Here are hatched plans for getting a share of the American bounty , the secret of the anti-missile missile , or an invitation to dinner . Out of it each week go hundreds of thousands of words purporting to inform home ministries about what is really happening inside Washington . Some , like the British and the French , maintain an elaborate system of personal contacts and have experts constantly studying special areas of the American scene . Other embassies cable home The New York Times without changing a comma . Each has its peculiar style . The Soviet Embassy is popularly regarded as Russian espionage headquarters . When Ambassador Mikhail Menshikov took it over in 1957 from Georgi Zaroubin , he made a determined effort to change this idea . Menshikov hit Washington with a TV announcer's grin and a hearty handclasp . To everyone's astonishment he seemed no more like the run-of-the-mine Russian ambassador than George Babbitt was like Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov . Where his predecessors had glowered , Menshikov smiled . Where they had affected the bleak social style of embalmers' assistants , Menshikov went abroad gorgeous in white tie and tails . Overnight he became the most available man in Washington . Speeches by the Soviet ambassador became the vogue as he obliged rural Maryland Rotarians and National Press Club alike . In Senator Joseph McCarthy's phrase , it was the most unheard-of thing ever heard of . A newspaperman who met him at a reception swore that he asked Menshikov : `` What should we call you '' ? And that Menshikov replied : `` Just call me Mike '' . `` Smilin' Mike '' was the sobriquet Washington gave him . His English was usable and he used it fearlessly . Toasting in champagne one night at the embassy , he hoisted his glass to a senator's wife and gaily cried : `` Up your bottom '' ! For a few giddy months that coincided with one of Moscow's smiling moods , he was the sensation of Washington . At the State Department , hard-bitten Russian experts complained that the Capitol was out of its wits . Newspaper punditry was inspired to remind everyone that Judas , too , had been able to smile . The Menshikov interlude ended as larks with the Russians usually end . Finding peaceful coexistence temporarily unsuitable because of domestic politics , Moscow resumed scowling and `` Smilin' Mike '' dropped quietly out of the press except for an occasional story reporting that he had been stoned somewhere in the Middle West . The most inscrutable embassies are the Arabs' , and the most inscrutable of the Arabs are the Saudi Arabians . When King Saud visited Washington , the overwhelming question consuming the press was the size of his family . Rumor had it that his children numbered in the hundreds . The State Department was little help on this , or on much else about Saudi Arabia . A reporter who consulted a Middle East Information officer for routine vital statistics got nowhere until the State Department man produced from his bottom desk drawer a brochure published by the Arabian-American Oil Company . `` This is where I get my information from '' , he confided . `` But bring it right back . It's the only copy I've got '' . The size of Saud's family was still being debated when the King appeared for his first meeting with Eisenhower . When it ended , a dusky sheik in desert robes flowed into Hagerty's office to report on the interview . The massed reporters brushed aside the customary bromides about Saudi-American friendship to bore in on the central question . How many children did the King have ? `` Twenty-one '' , replied the sheik . And how many of these were sons ? `` Twenty-five '' , the sheik replied . `` Do you mean to tell us '' , a reporter asked , `` that the King has twenty-one children , twenty-five of whom are sons '' ? The sheik smiled and murmured : `` That is precisely correct '' . The Egyptians are noted for elusiveness of language . When Dag Hammarskjold was negotiating the Middle East peace after Israel's 1956 invasion of Egypt , he soon found himself speaking the mysterious phrases of Cairo , a language as anarchic as Casey Stengel's . The reports of President Nasser's pledges which Hammarskjold was relaying from Cairo to Washington became increasingly incomprehensible to other diplomats , including the Israeli Foreign Minister , Mrs. Golda Meir . Finally he reported that Nasser was ready to make a concrete commitment in return for Israeli concessions . The deep water is used by many people , but it is always clean , for the washing is done outside . I know now why our Japanese friends were surprised when they walked into our bathroom . Of course , most toilets are Eastern style -- at floor level -- but even when they are raised to chair height , they are actually outside toilets -- inside . A few newer homes have Western flush toilets , but even with running water , they are usually Eastern style . The next day I visited International Christian College which has developed since the war under the leadership of people who were interned and who know Japan well . They are trying to demonstrate some different ways of teaching and learning . The library has open shelves even in the unbound periodical stockroom . Spiritual life is cultivated , but students do not need to be Christian . They have an enviable record of being able to place in employment 100% of their graduates . In the afternoon Miss Hosaka and her mother invited me to go with them and young Mrs. Kodama to see the famous Spring dances of the Geisha dancers . Mrs. Hosaka is one of the Japanese women one reads about -- beautiful , artistically talented , an artful manager of her big household -- ( four boys and four girls ) , and yet looking like a pampered , gentle Japanese woman . She was a real experience ! The dances were as beautiful as anything I have ever seen -- they rival the New York Rockettes for scenery and precision as well as imagination . Because Don was leaving the next day , I spent the evening with him at Asia Center . The following morning Mr. Morikawa called for me , and we went to visit schools -- kindergarten , middle-school , elementary school , and high school -- Mr. Yoshimoto's school . There is much more freedom in the schools here than I expected -- some think too much . There is a great deal of thought being given to the question of moral education in the schools . With the loss of the Emperor diety in Japan , the people are left in confusion with no God or moral teachings that have strength . The older parents continued to teach their children traditional principles , but the younger people , who have lost all faith and convictions , are now parents . There seems to be no purpose in life that is sure -- no certain guiding principles to give stability . As a result , money is spent quickly and freely , with no thought of its value . Gambling is everywhere , especially among students . Parents indulge their children . The government has recognized the dilemma and is beginning to devise some moral education for the schools -- but the teachers often have no firm conviction and are confused . I was told that it is quite likely that Japanese soldiers would not fight again -- for why should they ? It will be painful , but interesting , to see what kind of a god these people will create or what strong convictions they will develop . In the evening the former Oregon State science teachers met for dinner at the New Tokyo Restaurant where I had my first raw fish and found it good . They suggested several new foods , and usually I found them good , except the sweets , which I think I could learn to like . Six of the science teachers were present , and we had great fun . Kyoto After a day at Nikko , Mrs. Kodama put me on the train for Kyoto . My instructions were that Mr. Nishimo would meet me at the hotel , but instead he and three others were at the station with a very warm welcome . My hotel rooms on the trip were arranged by Masu and the Japan Travel Bureau and were more elegant than I would have chosen , but it was fun for once to be elegant -- I did explain to the students , however , that this was not my usual style , for their salaries are very small , and it seemed out of place for me to be housed so well . They understood and teased me a bit about it . I think I would have been much disappointed in Japan if I had not seen Kyoto , Nara , and Hiroshima . Kyoto is the ancient capital of Japan and still its cultural center . It , along with Nara , was untouched by the war -- and is now a beautiful example of the loveliness of prewar Japan . Here I was accompanied by Mrs. Okamoto ( Fumio's mother ) , her son , Mr. Washizu ( a prospective student with whom I have been corresponding for more than a year ) , and Mr. Nishima , one of the science teachers . I arrived at 7:00 a.m. and by 9:00 a.m. I had finished breakfast and was on my way to see what they had planned . We walked miles and saw various shrines and gardens . We visited the Okamoto home -- where for the first time I saw the famous tea ceremony . At 6:00 p.m. we went to the Kyoto Spring dances at the place where these beautiful dances originated . They were even better than those of Tokyo -- more spectacular and more imaginative . After a supper of unagi ( rice with eel -- eel which is raised in an ice-cold pond at the foot of Mt. Fuji ) , I returned to my beautiful room to sleep as hard as possible to be ready for another busy day . We started at 9 a.m. to visit the Kyoto University where Mr. Washizu is attending . I was amazed at the very poor hospital facilities accompanying the medical school . They apologized for the condition , including dirt and flies , and I was a little at a loss to know what to say . There seemed to be no excuse ? I don't have the answer yet . We had tea at Mr. Washizu's home where I learned that he , too , comes from a very wealthy family . His grandfather is a Buddhist priest ; ; and he , being the eldest , was supposed to be a priest , but he chose to do differently , and one of his brothers is to become the priest . This is a significant fact in Japan , for only a few years ago he would have had no choice . In his big home live four families and thirty people , so it needs to be big . Also , there are housed here some priceless historical treasures from 400 to 600 years old -- paintings , lacquer , brocade , etc. . He had displayed more of them than usual so that I could enjoy them . About 100 of the most important items he had already given to the museum . The house itself is 400 years old with all the craftsmanship of older , less-hurried times . Nara , Osaka , and Hiroshima Mr. Nishima went with me on the train to Nara . We passed his house and school on the way . In Nara I stayed at the hotel where the Prince and Princess had stayed on their honeymoon . A new red carpet had been laid for their coming , but I walked on it , too . Here Mr. Yoneda met us after a three-hour train trip from the town where he teaches . Even though we had walked miles in Kyoto that day , we started out again to see Nara at night . In the evening both of the men went with me on the train 30 miles to Osaka to put me on the train for Hiroshima . Again the plan was for me to go alone , but they wouldn't let me . At Osaka , Mr. Yoneda had to leave us to get the train to his home , but Mr. Nishima and I had an hour and a half before train time to see Osaka at night . It is the second largest city in Japan , with about four million people . One spot in Osaka I shall always remember -- the bridge where we stood to watch the reflections of the elaborate neon signs in the still waters of the river . In the midst of a great busy city , people take time to enjoy the beauty of natural reflection of artificial light . My train arrived in Hiroshima at the awful hour of 4:45 a.m. . I had planned to go to the hotel by taxi and sleep a little , after which Mr. Uno would arrive and pilot me around . But there he was at the train with an Oregon State pennant in his hand . I know now why the students insisted that I go to Hiroshima even when I told them I didn't want to . They knew that I was still grieving over the tragic event , and they felt that if I could see the recovery and the spirit of the people , who hold no grudge , but who also regret Pearl Harbor , I would be happier and would understand better a new Japan . There were no words to say this but there was no need . The teachers of Mr. Uno's school gave me a small gift to thank me for coming . Hiroshima is a better city than it was before -- in the minds of the people I met was a strong determination for peace and understanding . I was grateful for their insight into my need for this experience . A better world may yet come out of Hiroshima . Tokyo On arriving in Tokyo later we were met by Masu who took us immediately to her university , the Japanese Women's University . This day was `` Open House for Parents '' day , and the girls were busy preparing exhibits and arranging tea tables . Everything was in an exciting turmoil -- full of anticipation and fun . It was thrilling to see the effect of an American-trained teacher on Japanese students in a class in Home Planning . Our Masu is one of the very few architects in Japan who is trying to plan homes around family functions and women's needs . I am told the time will soon come when women will find it necessary to do most of their own work , and even now it is important to have conveniences for the use of servants . Many of the features of the homes are the latest modern devices in American homes , but an interesting blend of cultures finds us using Japanese artfulness in our own Western architecture at the same time that the Japanese are adopting Western utility patterns . At this Women's University we find a monument to a courageous family who believed that Japanese women also should be educated . Even today there are some doubts about the value of education for Japanese women , but this University continues to grow and to send its students out into the community . Active alumnae have built a fine building on the campus where members can come and stay for a few days or longer and where they can have their social gatherings and professional meetings . As far as I am concerned there is continuous piling up of evidence that the creative fresh ideas which are needed in the world are going to be found by educated women unafraid to break traditions . Masu is also teaching in a municipally-sponsored school for Japanese widows in Tokyo . Here the women learn to keep house as maids ; ; they become skilled in cooking and cleaning and in receiving guests . They learn how to take care of children and sick members of the family . They have model kitchens , a sick room with a model patient in bed , and a nursery with a life-like doll . Although the training is only for one month , it is intensive and thorough . Graduates of this maid's school are much in demand and can always find work immediately . Occasionally they return for additional training . Masu's home economics training comes into play as she designs cupboards along modern functional lines for the storage of cleaning materials . Masu also uses the training she got in an American home where she learned to polish furniture , clean corners , and work effectively in keeping a shiny house . Her education in the United States , not just in a classroom , but also in an American house with an American housekeeper , stands her in good stead . University of Tokyo After a fine luncheon in the cafeteria , the kitchen of which Masu had planned , Mr. Washizu and I left to meet representatives of the USIS for a visit to the University of Tokyo . Here again it was vacation time and there were many things I could not see , but I was able to visit with a professor who is famous in Japanese circles and be guided through the grounds by his assistant . The achievement of the desegregation of certain lunch counters not only by wise action by local community leaders but by voluntary action following consultation between Attorney General Rogers and the heads of certain national chain stores should , of course , be applauded . But for it to be just to attain this same result by means of the force of a boycott throughout the nation would require the verification of facts contrary to those assumed in the foregoing case . The suppositions in the previous illustration might be sufficiently altered by establishing a connection between general company practice and local practice in the South , and by establishing such direct connection between the practice and the economic well-being of stores located in New York and general company policy . Then the boycott would not be secondary , but a primary one . It would be directed against the actual location of the unjust policy which , for love's sake and for the sake of justice , must be removed , and , indivisible from this , to the economic injury of the people directly and objectively a part of this policy . Perhaps this would be sufficient to justify an economic boycott of an entire national chain in order , by threatening potential injury to its entire economy , to effect an alteration of the policy of its local stores in the matter of segregation . Such a general boycott might still be a blunt or indiscriminating instrument , and therefore of questionable justification . Action located where the evil is concentrated will prove most decisive and is most clearly legitimate . Moreover , prudence alone would indicate that , unless the local customs are already ready to fall when pushed , the results of direct economic action everywhere upon national chain stores will likely be simply to give undue advantage to local and state stores which conform to these customs , leading to greater decentralization and local autonomy within the company , or even ( as the final self-defeat of an unjust application of economic pressure to correct injustice ) to its going out of business in certain sections of the country ( as , for that matter , the Quakers , who once had many meetings in the pre-Civil War South , largely went out of business in that part of the country over the slavery issue , never to recover a large number of southern adherents ) . In any case , anyone who fails to make significant distinction between primary and secondary applications of economic pressure would in principle already have justified that use of economic boycott as a means which broke out a few years ago or was skillfully organized by White Citizens' Councils in the entire state of Mississippi against every local Philco dealer in that state , in protest against a Philco-sponsored program over a national TV network on which was presented a drama showing , it seemed , a `` high yellow gal '' smooching with a white man . It is true , of course , that the end or objective of this action was different . But since this is a world in which people disagree about ends and goals and concerning justice and injustice , and since , in a situation where direct action and economic pressure are called for , the justice of the matter has either not been clearly defined by law or the law is not effectively present , there has to be a morality of means applied in every case in which people take it upon themselves to use economic pressures or other forms of force . The need that we not give unqualified approval to any but a limited use of economic pressure directed against the actual doers of injustice is clear also in light of the fact that White Citizens' Councils seem resolved to maintain segregation mainly by the use of these same means and not ordinarily by physical violence . An unlimited use of economic pressures for diametrically opposite causes could devastate the pre-conditions of any fellow humanity as surely as this would be destroyed by the use of more obviously brutal means . The end or aim of the action , of course , is also important , especially where it is not alone a matter of changing community customs but of the use of deadly economic power to intimidate a person from stepping forward to claim his legal rights , e.g. , against Negroes who register to vote in Fayette County , Tennessee , at the present moment . Here the recourse is in steps to give economic sustenance to those being despoiled , and to legal remedies . This , however , is sufficient to show that more or less non-violent resistance and economic conflict ( if both sides are strong enough ) can be war of all against all no less than if other means are used . It is also sufficient to show the Christian and any other champion of justice that he needs to make sure not only that his cause is just but also that his conduct is just , i.e. , that , if economic pressure has to be resorted to , this be applied directly against those persons directly in the way of some salutary change in business or institutional practices , while , if injury fall upon others , it fall upon them indirectly and secondarily ( however inevitably ) and not by deliberate intent and direct action against them . It is clear that non-violent resistance is a mode of action in need of justification and limitation in Christian morality , like any other form of resistance . The language used itself often makes very clear that this is only another form of struggle for victory ( perhaps to be chosen above all others ) . One of the sit-in leaders has said : `` Nobody from the top of Heaven to the bottom of Hell can stop the march to freedom . Everybody in the world today might as well make up their minds to march with freedom or freedom is going to march over them '' . The present writer certainly agrees with that statement , and would also affirm this -- in the order of justice . However , it is also a Christian insight to know that unless charity interpenetrates justice it is not likely to be freedom that marches forward . And when charity interpenetrates man's struggle for justice and freedom it does not simply surround this with a sentimental good will . It also definitely fashions conduct in the way explained above , and this means far more than in the choice of non-violent means . R. B. Gregg has written that `` non-violence and good will of the victim act like the lack of physical opposition by the user of physical jiu-jitsu , to cause the attacker to lose his moral balance . He suddenly and unexpectedly loses the moral support which the usual violent resistance of most victims would render him '' ; ; and again , that `` the object of non-violent resistance is partly analogous to this object of war -- namely , to demoralize the opponent , to break his will , to destroy his confidence , enthusiasm , and hope . In another respect it is dissimilar , for non-violent resistance demoralizes the opponent only to re-establish in him a new morale that is firmer because it is based on sounder values '' . A trial of strength , however , is made quite inevitable by virtue of the fact that anyone engaging in non-violent resistance will be convinced that his action is based on sounder values than those of his opponent ; ; and in warfare with any means , men commonly disagree over the justice of the cause . This makes necessary a morality of means , and principles governing the conduct of resistance whenever this is thought to be justified . The question , then , is whether sufficient discrimination in the use of even non-violent means of coercion is to be found in the fact that such conduct demoralizes and overcomes the opponent while re-moralizing and re-establishing him . Here it is relevant to remember that men commonly regard some causes as more important than their lives ; ; and to them it will seem insignificant that it is proposed to defeat such causes non-violently . A technique by which it is proposed to enter with compulsion into the very heart of a man and determine his values may often in fact seem the more unlimited aggression . Among Christian groups , the Mennonites have commonly been aware more than others of the fact that the nature of divine charity raises decisively the question of the Christian use of all forms of pressure . Since the will and word of God are for them concentrated in Christ-like love , it seems clear to them that non-violent resistance is quite another thing . `` The primary objective of non-violence '' , writes the outstanding Mennonite ethicist , `` is not peace , or obedience to the divine will , but rather certain desired social changes , for personal , or class , or national advantage '' . Without agreeing with every phrase in this statement , we must certainly assert the great difference between Christian love and any form of resistance , and then go on beyond the Mennonite position and affirm that Christian love-in-action must first justify and then determine the moral principles limiting resistance . These principles we have now set forth . Economy in the use of power needs not only to be asserted , but clearly specified ; ; and when this is done it will be found that the principles governing Christian resistance cut across the distinction between violent and non-violent means , and apply to both alike , justifying either on occasion and always limiting either action . Economy in the use of power means more than inflicting a barely intolerable pressure upon an opponent and upon the injustice opposed . That would amount to calculating the means and justifying them wholly in terms of their effectiveness in reaching desired goals . There must also be additional and more fundamental discrimination in the use of means of resistance , violent or non-violent . The justification in Christian conscience of the use of any mode of resistance also lays down its limitation -- in the distinction between the persons against whom pressure is primarily directed , those upon whom it may be permitted also to fall , and those who may never be directly repressed for the sake even of achieving some great good . In these terms , the `` economic withdrawal '' of the Negroes of Nashville , Tennessee , from trading in the center city , for example , was clearly justified , since these distinctions do not require that only people subjectively guilty be singled out . We may now take up for consideration a hard case which seems to require either no action employing economic pressure or else action that would seem to violate the principles set forth above . There may be instances in which , if economic pressure is to be undertaken at all , this would have to be applied without discrimination against a whole people . An excellent article was published recently in the Journal Of The Church Peace Union by a South African journalist on the inhuman economic conditions of the blacks in South Africa , amounting to virtual slavery , and the economic complicity of both the government and the people of the United States in these conditions . `` Billions of American dollars , not only from capital investors but also from the pockets of U.S. taxpayers '' , this author states , `` are being poured into South Africa to support a system dedicated to the oppression , the persecution , and the almost diabolical exploitation of 12 million people the color of whose skins happens not to be white '' . Both the conditions and the complicity are documented in considerable detail . This leads to the conclusion that `` the fact is inescapable that America does have a say in whether or not apartheid shall continue '' . Our leadership in a wide economic boycott of South Africa would be not only in accord , it seems , with the moral conscience of America , not to be denied because we also as a people have widespread injustice in the relations of the races in our own country , but also in accord with our law , U.S. Code Title 19 , Section 1307 , which forbids the importation of goods made by forced or convict labor . Not only should this provision be enforced but other economic and political actions might be taken which , this author believes , `` must surely be supported by every American who values the freedom that has been won for him and whose conscience is not so dominated by the lines in his account books that he can willingly and knowingly contribute to the enslavement of another nation '' . Northern liberals are the chief supporters of civil rights and of integration . They have also led the nation in the direction of a welfare state . And both in their objectives of non-discrimination and of social progress they have had ranged against them the Southerners who are called Bourbons . The name presumably derives from the French royal house which never learned and never forgot ; ; since Bourbon whiskey , though of Kentucky origin , is at least as much favored by liberals in the North as by conservatives in the South . The nature of the opposition between liberals and Bourbons is too little understood in the North . The race problem has tended to obscure other , less emotional , issues which may fundamentally be even more divisive . It is these other differences between North and South -- other , that is , than those which concern discrimination or social welfare -- which I chiefly discuss herein . I write about Northern liberals from considerable personal experience . A Southerner married to a New Englander , I have lived for many years in a Connecticut commuting town with a high percentage of artists , writers , publicity men , and business executives of egghead tastes . Most of them are Democrats and nearly all consider themselves , and are viewed as , liberals . This is puzzling to an outsider conscious of the classic tradition of liberalism , because it is clear that these Democrats who are left-of-center are at opposite poles from the liberal Jefferson , who held that the best government was the least government . Yet paradoxically my liberal friends continue to view Jefferson as one of their patron saints . When I question them as to what they mean by concepts like liberty and democracy , I find that they fall into two categories : the simpler ones who have simply accepted the shibboleths of their faith without analysis ; ; and the intelligent , cynical ones who scornfully reply that these things don't count any more in the world of to-day . I am naive , they say , to make use of such words . I take this to mean that the intelligent -- and therefore necessarily cynical ? -- liberal considers that the need for a national economy with controls that will assure his conception of social justice is so great that individual and local liberties as well as democratic processes may have to yield before it . This seems like an attitude favoring a sort of totalitarian bureaucracy which , under a President of the same stamp , would try to coerce an uncooperative Congress or Supreme Court . As for states' rights , they have never counted in the thinking of my liberal friends except as irritations of a minor and immoral nature which exist now only as anachronisms . The American liberal may , in the world of to-day , have a strong case ; ; but he presents it publicly so enmeshed in hypocrisy that it is not an honest one . Why , in the first place , call himself a liberal if he is against laissez-faire and favors an authoritarian central government with womb-to-tomb controls over everybody ? If he attaches little importance to personal liberty , why not make this known to the world ? And if he is so scornful of the rights of states , why not advocate a different sort of constitution that he could more sincerely support ? I am concerned here , however , with the Northern liberal's attitude toward the South . It appears to be one of intense dislike , which he makes little effort to conceal even in the presence of Southern friends . His assumption seems to be that any such friends , being tolerable humans , must be more liberal than most Southerners and therefore at least partly in sympathy with his views . Time's editor , Thomas Griffith , in his book , The Waist-High Culture , wrote : `` most of what was different about it ( the Deep South ) I found myself unsympathetic to . '' This , for the liberals I know , would be an understatement . Theirs is no mere lack of sympathy , but something closer to the passionate hatred that was directed against Fascism . I do not think that my experience would be typical for Southerners living in the North . In business circles , usually conservative , this sort of atmosphere would hardly be found . But in our case -- and neither my wife nor I have extreme views on integration , nor are we given to emotional outbursts -- the situation has ruined one or two valued friendships and come close to wrecking several more . In fact it has caused us to give serious thought to moving our residence south , because it is not easy for the most objective Southerner to sit calmly by when his host is telling a roomful of people that the only way to deal with Southerners who oppose integration is to send in troops and shoot the bastards down . Accounts have been published of Northern liberals in the South up against segregationist prejudice , especially in state-supported universities where pressure may be strong to uphold the majority view . But these accounts do not show that Northerners have been subjected to embarrassment or provocation by Yankee-hatred displayed in social gatherings . From my wife's experience and other sources , this seems to be rarely encountered in educated circles . The strong feeling is certainly there ; ; but there is a leavening of liberalism among college graduates throughout the South , especially among those who studied in the North . And social relations arising out of business ties impose courtesy , if not sympathy , toward resident and visiting Northerners . Also , among the latter a large percentage soon acquire the prevalent Southern attitude on most social problems . There are of course many Souths ; ; but for this discussion the most important division is between those who have been reconstructed and those who haven't . My definition of this much abused adjective is that a reconstructed rebel is one who is glad that the North won the War . Nobody knows how many Southerners there are in this category . I suspect that there are far more unreconstructed ones than the North likes to believe . I never heard of a poll being taken on the question . No doubt such a thing would be considered unpatriotic . Prior to 1954 I imagine that a majority of Southerners would have voted against the Confederacy . Since the Supreme Court's decision of that year this is more doubtful ; ; and if a poll had been taken immediately following the dispatch of troops to Little Rock I believe the majority would have been for the Old South . Belief in the traditional way of life persists much more in the older states than in the new ones . Probably a larger percentage of Virginians and South Carolinians remain unreconstructed than elsewhere , with Georgia , North Carolina , and Alabama following along after them . Old attitudes are held more tenaciously in the Tidewater than the Piedmont ; ; so that a line running down the length of the South marking the upper limits of tidewater would roughly divide the Old South from the new , but with , of course , important minority enclaves . The long-settled areas of states like Virginia and South Carolina developed the ante-bellum culture to its richest flowering , and there the memory is more precious , and the consciousness of loss the greater . Also , we should not even to-day discount the fact that a region such as the coastal lowlands centering on Charleston had closer ties with England and the West Indies than with the North even after independence . The social and psychological consequences of this continue to affect the area . In certain respects defeat increased the persistent Anglophilia of the Old South . Poor where they had once been rich , humbled where they had been arrogant , having no longer any hope of sharing in the leadership of the nation , the rebels who would not surrender in spirit drew comfort from the sympathy they felt extended to them by the mother country . And no doubt many people in states like the Carolinas and Georgia , which were among the most Tory in sentiment in the eighteenth century , bitterly regretted the revolt against the Crown . Among Bourbons the racial issue may have less to do with their remaining unreconstructed than other factors . All Southerners agree that slavery had to go ; ; but many historians maintain that except for Northern meddling it would have ended in states like Virginia years before it did . Southern resentment has been over the method of its ending , the invasion , and Reconstruction ; ; their fears now are of miscegenation and Negro political control in many counties . But apart from racial problems , the old unreconstructed South -- to use the moderate words favored by Mr. Thomas Griffith -- finds itself unsympathetic to most of what is different about the civilization of the North . And this , in effect , means most of modern America . It is hard to see how the situation could be otherwise . And therein , I feel , many Northerners delude themselves about the South . For one thing , this is not a subject often discussed or analyzed . There seems to be almost a conspiracy of silence veiling it . I suppose the reason is a kind of wishful thinking : don't talk about the final stages of Reconstruction and they will take care of themselves . Or else the North really believes that all Southerners except a few quaint old characters have come around to realizing the errors of their past , and are now at heart sharers of the American Dream , like everybody else . If the circumstances are faced frankly it is not reasonable to expect this to be true . The situation of the South since 1865 has been unique in the western world . Regardless of rights and wrongs , a population and an area appropriate to a pre-World-War- 1 great power have been , following conquest , ruled against their will by a neighboring people , and have had imposed upon them social and economic controls they dislike . And the great majority of these people are of Anglo-Saxon or Celtic descent . This is the only case in modern history of a people of Britannic origin submitting without continued struggle to what they view as foreign domination . The fact is due mainly to international wars , both hot and cold . In every war of the United States since the Civil War the South was more belligerent than the rest of the country . So instead of being tests of the South's loyalty , the Spanish War , the two World Wars , and the Korean War all served to overcome old grievances and cement reunion . And there is no section of the nation more ardent than the South in the cold war against Communism . Had the situation been reversed , had , for instance , England been the enemy in 1898 because of issues of concern chiefly to New England , there is little doubt that large numbers of Southerners would have happily put on their old Confederate uniforms to fight as allies of Britain . It is extraordinary that a people as proud and warlike as Southerners should have been as docile as they have . The North should thank its stars that such has been the case ; ; but at the same time it should not draw false inferences therefrom . The two main charges levelled against the Bourbons by liberals is that they are racists and social reactionaries . There is much truth in both these charges , and not many Bourbons deny them . Whatever their faults , they are not hypocrites . Most of them sincerely believe that the Anglo-Saxon is the best race in the world and that it should remain pure . Many Northeners believe this , too , but few of them will say so publicly . The Bourbon economic philosophy , moreover , is not very different from that of Northern conservatives . But those among the Bourbons who remain unreconstructed go much further than this . They believe that if the South had been let alone it would have produced a civilization superior to that of modern America . As it is , they consider that the North is now reaping the fruits of excess egalitarianism , that in spite of its high standard of living the `` American way '' has been proved inferior to the English and Scandinavian ways , although they disapprove of the socialistic features of the latter . The South's antipathy to Northern civilization includes such charges as poor manners , harsh accents , lack of appreciation of the arts of living like gastronomy and the use of leisure . Their own easier , slower tempo is especially dear to Southerners ; ; and I have heard many say that they are content to earn a half or a third as much as they could up North because they so much prefer the quieter habits of their home town . In the past , the duties of the state , as Sir Henry Maine noted long ago , were only two in number : internal order and external security . By prevailing over other claimants for the loyalties of men , the nation-state maintained an adequate measure of certainty and order within its territorial borders . Outside those limits it asserted , as against other states , a position of sovereign equality , and , as against the `` inferior '' peoples of the non-Western world , a position of dominance . It became the sole `` subject '' of `` international law '' ( a term which , it is pertinent to remember , was coined by Bentham ) , a body of legal principle which by and large was made up of what Western nations could do in the world arena . ( That corpus of law was a reflection of the power system in existence during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries . Speaking generally , it furthered -- and still tends to further -- the interests of the Western powers . The enormous changes in world politics have , however , thrown it into confusion , so much so that it is safe to say that all international law is now in need of reexamination and clarification in light of the social conditions of the present era . ) Beyond the two basic tasks mentioned above , no attention was paid by statesman or scholar to an idea of state responsibility , either internally or externally . This was particularly true in the world arena , which was an anarchical battleground characterized by strife and avaricious competition for colonial empires . That any sort of duty was owed by his nation to other nations would have astonished a nineteenth-century statesman . His duty was to his sovereign and to his nation , and an extension to peoples beyond the territorial boundaries was not to be contemplated . Thus , to cite but one example , the Pax Britannica of the nineteenth century , whether with the British navy ruling the seas or with the City of London ruling world finance , was strictly national in motivation , however much other nations ( e.g. , the United States ) may have incidentally benefited . At the same time , all suggestions that some sort of societal responsibility existed for the welfare of the people within the territorial state was strongly resisted . Social Darwinism was able to stave off the incipient socialist movement until well into the present century . However , in recent decades , for what doubtless are multiple reasons , an unannounced but nonetheless readily observable shift has occurred in both facets of national activity . A concept of responsibility is in process of articulation and establishment . Already firmly implanted internally , it is a growing factor in external matters . A little more than twenty years ago the American people turned an important corner . In what has aptly been called a `` constitutional revolution '' , the basic nature of government was transformed from one essentially negative in nature ( the `` night-watchman state '' ) to one with affirmative duties to perform . The `` positive state '' came into existence . For lawyers , reflecting perhaps their parochial preferences , there has been a special fascination since then in the role played by the Supreme Court in that transformation -- the manner in which its decisions altered in `` the switch in time that saved nine '' , President Roosevelt's ill-starred but in effect victorious `` Court-packing plan '' , the imprimatur of judicial approval that was finally placed upon social legislation . Of greater importance , however , is the content of those programs , which have had and are having enormous consequences for the American people . Labor relations have been transformed , income security has become a standardized feature of political platforms , and all the many facets of the American version of the welfare state have become part of the conventional wisdom . A national consensus of near unanimity exists that these governmental efforts are desirable as well as necessary . Ratified in the Republican Party victory in 1952 , the Positive State is now evidenced by political campaigns being waged not on whether but on how much social legislation there should be . The general acceptance of the idea of governmental ( i.e. , societal ) responsibility for the economic well-being of the American people is surely one of the two most significant watersheds in American constitutional history . The other , of course , was the Civil War , the conflict which a century ago insured national unity over fragmentation . A third , one of at least equal and perhaps even greater importance , is now being traversed : American immersion and involvement in world affairs . Internal national responsibility , now a truism , need not be documented . Nevertheless , it may be helpful to cite one example -- that of employment -- for , as will be shown below , it cuts across both facets of the new concept . Thirty years ago , while the nation was wallowing in economic depression , the prevailing philosophy of government was to stand aside and allow `` natural forces '' to operate and cure the distress . That guiding principle of the Hoover Administration fell to the siege guns of the New Deal ; ; less than a score of years later Congress enacted the Employment Act of 1946 , by which the national government assumed the responsibility of taking action to insure conditions of maximum employment . Hands-off the economy was replaced by conscious guidance through planning -- the economic side of the constitutional revolution . In 1961 the first important legislative victory of the Kennedy Administration came when the principle of national responsibility for local economic distress won out over a `` state's-responsibility '' proposal -- provision was made for payment for unemployment relief by nation-wide taxation rather than by a levy only on those states afflicted with manpower surplus . The American people have indeed come a long way in the brief interval between 1930 and 1961 . Internal national responsibility is a societal response to the impact of the Industrial Revolution . Reduced to its simplest terms , it is an assumption of a collective duty to compensate for the inability of individuals to cope with the rigors of the era . National responsibility for individual welfare is a concept not limited to the United States or even to the Western nations . A measure of its widespread acceptance may be derived from a statement of the International Congress of Jurists in 1959 . Meeting in New Delhi under the auspices of the International Commission of Jurists , a body of lawyers from the free world , the Congress redefined and expanded the traditional Rule of Law to include affirmative governmental duties . It is noteworthy that the majority of the delegates to the Congress were from the less developed , former colonial nations . The Rule of Law , historically a principle according everyone his `` day in court '' before an impartial tribunal , was broadened substantively by making it a responsibility of government to promote individual welfare . Recognizing that the Rule of Law is `` a dynamic concept which should be employed not only to safeguard the civil and political rights of the individual in a free society '' , the Congress asserted that it also included the responsibility `` to establish social , economic , educational and cultural conditions under which his legitimate aspirations and dignity may be realized '' . The idea of national responsibility thus has become a common feature of the nations of the non-Soviet world . For better or for worse , we all now live in welfare states , the organizing principle of which is collective responsibility for individual well-being . Whether a concept analogous to the principle of internal responsibility operates in a nation's external relations is less obvious and more difficult to establish . The hypothesis ventured here is that it does , and that evidence is accumulating validating that proposition . The content is not the same , however : rather than individual security , it is the security and continuing existence of an `` ideological group '' -- those in the `` free world '' -- that is basic . External national responsibility involves a burgeoning requirement that the leaders of the Western nations so guide their decisions as to further the viability of other friendly nations . If internal responsibility suggests acceptance of the socialist ideal of equality , then external responsibility implies adherence to principles of ideological supranationalism . Reference to two other concepts -- nationalism and sovereignty -- may help to reveal the contours of the new principle . In its beginnings the nation-state had to struggle to assert itself -- internally , against feudal groups , and externally , against the power and influence of such other claimants for loyalty as the Church . The breakup of the Holy Roman Empire and the downfall of feudalism led , not more than two centuries ago , to the surge of nationalism . ( Since the time-span of the nation-state coincides roughly with the separate existence of the United States as an independent entity , it is perhaps natural for Americans to think of the nation as representative of the highest form of order , something permanent and unchanging . ) The concept of nationalism is the political principle that epitomizes and glorifies the territorial state as the characteristic type of socal structure . But it is more than that . For it includes the emotional ties that bind men to their homeland and the complex motivations that hold a large group of people together as a unit . Today , as new nations rise from the former colonial empires , nationalism is one of the hurricane forces loose in the world . Almost febrile in intensity , the principle has become worldwide in application -- unfortunately at the very time that nationalist fervors can wreak greatest harm . Historically , however , the concept is one that has been of marked benefit to the people of the Western civilizational group . By subduing disparate lesser groups the nation has , to some degree at least , broadened the capacity for individual liberty . Within their confines , moreover , technological and industrial growth has proceeded at an accelerated pace , thus increasing the cornucopia from which material wants can be satisfied . While the pattern is uneven , some having gained more than others , nationalism has in fact served the Western peoples well . ( Whether historical nationalism helped the peoples of the remainder of the world , and whether today's nationalism in the former colonial areas has equally beneficial aspects , are other questions . ) It is one of the ironic quirks of history that the viability and usefulness of nationalism and the territorial state are rapidly dissipating at precisely the time that the nation-state attained its highest number ( approximately 100 ) . But it is more than irony : one of the main reasons why nationalism is no longer a tenable concept is because it has spread throughout the planet . In other words , nationalism worked well enough when it had limited application , both as to geography and as to population ; ; it becomes a perilous anachronism when adopted on a world-wide basis . Complementing the political principle of nationalism is the legal principle of sovereignty . The former receives its legitimacy from the latter . Operating side by side , together they helped shore up the nation-state . While sovereignty has roots in antiquity , in its present usage it is essentially modern . Jean Bodin , writing in the sixteenth century , may have been the seminal thinker , but it was the vastly influential John Austin who set out the main lines of the concept as now understood . Austin's nineteenth-century view of law and sovereignty still dominates much of today's legal and political thinking . To him , law is the command of the sovereign ( the English monarch ) who personifies the power of the nation , while sovereignty is the power to make law -- i.e. , to prevail over internal groups and to be free from the commands of other sovereigns in other nations . These fundamental ideas -- the indivisibility of sovereignty and its dual ( internal-external ) aspects -- still remain the core of that concept of ultimate political power . The nation-state , then , exemplifies the principle of nationalism and exercises sovereignty : supreme power over domestic affairs and independence from outside control . In fact , however , both principles have always been nebulous and loosely defined . High-level abstractions are always difficult to pin down with precision . That is particularly true of sovereignty when it is applied to democratic societies , in which `` popular '' sovereignty is said to exist , and in federal nations , in which the jobs of government are split . Nevertheless , nationalism and sovereignty are reputed , in the accepted wisdom , to describe the modern world . Is there a different reality behind the facade ? Does the surface hide a quite different picture ? The short answer to those questions is `` yes '' . Both concepts are undergoing alteration ; ; to some degree they are being supplanted by a concept of national responsibility . As evidence to support that view , consider the following illustrative instances . Can thermonuclear war be set off by accident ? What steps have been taken to guard against the one sort of mishap that could trigger the destruction of continents ? Are we as safe as we should be from such a disaster ? Is anything being done to increase our margin of safety ? Will the danger increase or decrease ? I have just asked these questions in the Pentagon , in the White House , in offices of key scientists across the country and aboard the submarines that prowl for months underwater , with neat rows of green launch tubes which contain Polaris missiles and which are affectionately known as `` Sherwood Forest '' . I asked the same questions inside the launch-control rooms of an Atlas missile base in Wyoming , where officers who wear sidearms are manning the `` commit buttons '' that could start a war -- accidentally or by design -- and in the command centers where other pistol-packing men could give orders to push such buttons . To the men in the instrument-jammed bomber cockpits , submarine compartments and the antiseptic , windowless rooms that would be the foxholes of tomorrow's impersonal intercontinental wars , the questions seem farfetched . There is unceasing pressure , but its sources are immediate . `` Readiness exercises '' are almost continuous . Each could be the real thing . In the command centers there are special clocks ready to tick off the minutes elapsed since `` E hour '' . `` E '' stands for `` execution '' -- the moment a `` go order '' would unleash an American nuclear strike . There is little time for the men in the command centers to reflect about the implications of these clocks . They are preoccupied riding herd on control panels , switches , flashing colored lights on pale green or gray consoles that look like business machines . They know little about their machinery beyond mechanical details . Accidental war is so sensitive a subject that most of the people who could become directly involved in one are told just enough so they can perform their portions of incredibly complex tasks . Among the policy makers , generals , physicists , psychologists and others charged with controlling the actions of the button pushers and their `` hardware '' , the answers to my questions varied partly according to a man's flair for what the professionals in this field call `` scenarios '' . As an Air Force psychiatrist put it : `` You can't have dry runs on this one '' . The experts are thus forced to hypothesize sequences of events that have never occurred , probably never will -- but possibly might . Only one rule prevailed in my conversations with these men : The more highly placed they are -- that is , the more they know -- the more concerned they have become . Already accidental war is a silent guest at the discussions within the Kennedy Administration about the urgency of disarmament and nearly all other questions of national security . Only recently new `` holes '' were discovered in our safety measures , and a search is now on for more . Work is under way to see whether new restraining devices should be installed on all nuclear weapons . Meanwhile , the experts speak of wars triggered by `` false pre-emption '' , `` escalation '' , `` unauthorized behavior '' and other terms that will be discussed in this report . They inhabit a secret world centered on `` go codes '' and `` gold phones '' . Their conversations were , almost invariably , accompanied by the same gestures -- arms and pointed forefingers darting toward each other in arclike semicircular motions . One arm represented our bombers and missiles , the other arm `` theirs '' . Yet implicit in each movement was the death of millions , perhaps hundreds of millions , perhaps you and me -- and the experts . These men are not callous . It is their job to think about the unthinkable . Unanimously they believe that the world would become a safer place if more of us -- and more Russians and Communist Chinese , too -- thought about accidental war . The first systematic thinking about this Pandora's box within Pandora's boxes was done four years ago by Fred Ikle , a frail , meek-mannered Swiss-born sociologist . He was , and is , with the RAND Corporation , a nonprofit pool of thinkers financed by the U.S. Air Force . His investigations made him the Paul Revere of accidental war , and safety procedures were enormously increased . In recent weeks , as a result of a sweeping defense policy reappraisal by the Kennedy Administration , basic United States strategy has been modified -- and large new sums allocated -- to meet the accidental-war danger and to reduce it as quickly as possible . The chain starts at BMEWS ( Ballistic Missile Early Warning System ) in Thule , Greenland . Its radar screens would register Soviet missiles shortly after they are launched against the United States . BMEWS intelligence is simultaneously flashed to NORAD ( North American Air Defense Command ) in Colorado Springs , Colorado , for interpretation ; ; to the SAC command and control post , forty-five feet below the ground at Offutt Air Force Base , near Omaha , Nebraska ; ; to the Joint War Room of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the Pentagon and to the President . Telephones , Teletypes , several kinds of radio systems and , in some cases , television , link all vital points . Alternate locations exist for all key command centers . For last-ditch emergencies SAC has alternate command posts on KC-135 jet tankers . Multiple circuits , routings and frequencies make the chain as unbreakable as possible . The same principle of `` redundancy '' applies to all communications on these special networks . And no messages can be transmitted on these circuits until senders and receivers authenticate in advance , by special codes , that the messages actually come from their purported sources . Additional codes can be used to challenge and counterchallenge the authentications . Only the President is permitted to authorize the use of nuclear weapons . That's the law . But what if somebody decides to break it ? The President cannot personally remove the safety devices from every nuclear trigger . He makes the momentous decision . Hundreds of men are required to pass the word to the button pushers and to push the buttons . What if one or more of them turn irrational or suddenly , coolly , decide to clobber the Russians ? What if the President himself , in the language of the military , `` goes ape '' ? Or singlehandedly decided to reverse national policy and hit the Soviets without provocation ? Nobody can be absolutely certain of the answers . However , the system is designed , ingeniously and hopefully , so that no one man could initiate a thermonuclear war . Even the President cannot pick up his telephone and give a `` go '' order . Even he does not know the one signal for a nuclear strike -- the `` go code '' . In an emergency he would receive available intelligence on the `` gold-phone circuit '' . A system of `` gold '' -- actually yellow -- phones connects him with the offices and action stations of the Secretary of Defense , the Joint Chiefs of Staff , the SAC commander and other key men . All can be connected with the gold circuit from their homes . All could help the President make his decision . The talk would not be in code , but neither would it ramble . Vital questions would be quickly answered according to a preprepared agenda . Officers who participate in the continual practice drills assured me that the President's decision could be made and announced on the gold circuit within minutes after the first flash from Aj . If communications work , his decision would be instantly known in all command posts that would originate the actual go order . For these centers , too , are on the gold circuit . They include the Navy's Atlantic Command at Norfolk , Virginia , which is in contact with the Polaris subs ; ; NATO headquarters in Europe ; ; Air Force forward headquarters in Europe and in the Pacific , which control tactical fighters on ships and land bases ; ; and SAC , which controls long-range bombers and Atlas missiles . Let us look in on one of these nerve centers -- SAC at Omaha -- and see what must still happen before a wing of B-52 bombers could drop their Aj . In a word , plenty . The key man almost certainly would be Col. William W. Wisman , SAC's senior controller . He or his deputy or one of their seven assistants , all full colonels , mans the heart of the command post twenty-four hours a day . It is a quiet but impressive room -- 140 feet long , thirty-nine feet wide , twenty-one feet high . Movable panels of floor-to-ceiling maps and charts are crammed with intelligence information . And Bill Wisman , forty-three , a farmer's son from Beallsville , Ohio , is a quiet but impressive man . His eyes are steady anchors of the deepest brown . His movements and speech are precise , clear and quick . No question ruffles him or causes him to hesitate . Wisman , who has had the chief controller's job for four years , calls the signals for a team operating three rows of dull-gray consoles studded with lights , switches and buttons . At least a dozen men , some armed , are never far away from him . In front of him is a gold phone . In emergencies the SAC commander , Gen. Thomas Power , or his deputies and their staff would occupy a balcony that stretches across the length of the room above Wisman and his staff . At General Power's seat in the balcony there is also a gold phone . General Power would participate in the decision making . Wisman , below , would listen in and act . His consoles can give him instant contact with more than seventy bases around the world and with every SAC aircraft . He need only pick up one of the two red telephone receivers at his extreme left , right next to the big red button marked alert . ( There are two receivers in case one should be dropped and damaged . ) But Wisman , too , does not know the go code . He must take it from `` the red box '' . In point of fact , this is a beige box with a bright red door , about one and a half feet square and hung from the wall about six feet from the door to Wisman's right . The box is internally wired so the door can never be opened without setting off a screeching klaxon ( `` It's real obnoxious '' ) . Now we must become vague , for we are approaching one of the nation's most guarded secrets . The codes in the red box -- there are several of them covering various contingencies -- are contained in a sealed X-ray-proof `` unique device '' . They are supplied , a batch at a time , by a secret source and are continually changed by Wisman or his staff , at random intervals . But even the contents of Wisman's box cannot start a war . They are mere fragments , just one portion of preprepared messages . What these fragments are and how they activate the go order may not be revealed . The pieces must be placed in the context of the prepared messages by Wisman's staff . In addition to the authentication and acknowledgment procedures which precede and follow the sending of the go messages , again in special codes , each message also contains an `` internal authenticator '' , another specific signal to convince the recipient that he is getting the real thing . I asked Wisman what would happen if he broke out the go codes and tried to start transmitting one . `` I'd wind up full of bullet holes '' , he said , and there was no question that he was talking about bullets fired by his coworkers . Now let us imagine a wing of B-52's , on alert near their `` positive control ( or fail-safe ) points '' , the spots on the map , many miles from Soviet territory , beyond which they are forbidden to fly without specific orders to proceed to their targets . They , too , have fragments of the go code with them . As Wisman put it , `` They have separate pieces of the pie , and we have the whole pie . Once we send out the whole pie , they can put their pieces into it . Unless we send out the whole pie , their pieces mean nothing '' . Why does Wisman's ever-changing code always mesh with the fragments in possession of the button pushers ? The answer is a cryptographic secret . At any rate , three men out of a six-man B-52 crew are required to copy down Wisman's go-to-war message . Each must match Wisman's `` pie '' with the fragment that he carries with him . All three must compare notes and agree to `` go '' . After that , it requires several minutes of concentrated work , including six separate and deliberate actions by a minimum of three men sitting at three separate stations in a bomber , each with another man beside him to help , for an armed bomb to be released . Unless all gadgets are properly operated -- and the wires and seals from the handles removed first -- no damage can be done . Suddenly , however , their posture changed and the game ended . They went as rigid as black statuary six figures , lean and tall and angular , went still . Their heads were in the air sniffing . They all swung at the same instant in the same direction . They saw it before I did , even with my binoculars . It was nothing more than a tiny distant rain squall , a dull gray sheet which reached from a layer of clouds to the earth . In the 360 degrees of horizon it obscured only a degree , no more . A white man would not have seen it . The aborigines fastened upon it with a concentration beyond pathos . Watching , they waited until the squall thickened and began to move in a long drifting slant across the dry burning land . At once the whole band set off at a lope . They were chasing a rain cloud . They went after the squall as mercilessly as a wolf pack after an abandoned cow . I followed them in the jeep and now they did not care . The games were over , this was life . Occasionally , for no reason that I could see , they would suddenly alter the angle of their trot . Sometimes I guessed it was because the rain squall had changed direction . Sometimes it was to skirt a gulley . Their gait is impossible to convey in words . It has nothing of the proud stride of the trained runner about it , it is not a lope , it is not done with style or verve . It is the gait of the human who must run to live : arms dangling , legs barely swinging over the ground , head hung down and only occasionally swinging up to see the target , a loose motion that is just short of stumbling and yet is wonderfully graceful . It is a barely controlled skimming of the ground . They ran for three hours . Finally , avoiding hummocks and seeking low ground , they intercepted the rain squall . For ten minutes they ran beneath the squall , raising their arms and , for the first time , shouting and capering . Then the wind died and the rain squall held steady . They were studying the ground . Suddenly one of them shouted , ran a few feet , bent forward and put his mouth to the ground . He had found a depression with rain water in it . He bent down , a black cranelike figure , and put his mouth to the ground . With a lordly and generous gesture , the discoverer stood up and beckoned to the closest of his fellows . The other trotted over and swooped at the tiny puddle . In an instant he had sucked it dry . The aborigine lives on the cruelest land I have ever seen . Which does not mean that it is ugly . Part of it is , of course . There are thousands of square miles of salt pan which are hideous . They are huge areas which have been swept by winds for so many centuries that there is no soil left , but only deep bare ridges fifty or sixty yards apart with ravines between them thirty or forty feet deep and the only thing that moves is a scuttling layer of sand . Such stretches have an inhuman moonlike quality . But much of the land which the aborigine wanders looks as if it should be hospitable . It is softened by the saltbush and the bluebush , has a peaceful quality , the hills roll softly . The malignancy of such a landscape has been beautifully described by the Australian Charles Bean . He tells of three men who started out on a trip across a single paddock , a ten-by-ten-mile square owned by a sheep grazer . They went well-equipped with everything except knowledge of the `` outback '' country . `` The countryside looked like a beautiful open park with gentle slopes and soft gray tree-clumps . Nothing appalling or horrible rushed upon these men . Only there happened -- nothing . There might have been a pool of cool water behind any of these tree-clumps : only -- there was not . It might have rained , any time ; ; only -- it did not . There might have been a fence or a house just over the next rise ; ; only -- there was not . They lay , with the birds hopping from branch to branch above them and the bright sky peeping down at them . No one came '' . The white men died . And countless others like them have died . Even today range riders will come upon mummified bodies of men who attempted nothing more difficult than a twenty-mile hike and slowly lost direction , were tortured by the heat , driven mad by the constant and unfulfilled promise of the landscape , and who finally died . The aborigine is not deceived ; ; he knows that the land is hard and pitiless . He knows that the economy of life in the `` outback '' is awful . There is no room for error or waste . Any organism that falters or misperceives the signals or weakens is done . I do not know if such a way of life can come to be a self-conscious challenge , but I suspect that it can . Perhaps this is what gives the aborigine his odd air of dignity . The family at the boulder seeing an aborigine today is a difficult thing . Many of them have drifted into the cities and towns and seaports . Others are confined to vast reservations , and not only does the Australian government justifiably not wish them to be viewed as exhibits in a zoo , but on their reservations they are extremely fugitive , shunning camps , coming together only for corroborees at which their strange culture comes to its highest pitch -- which is very low indeed . I persuaded an Australian friend who had lived `` outback '' for years to take me to see some aborigines living in the bush . It was a difficult and ambiguous kind of negotiation , even though the rancher was said to be expert in his knowledge of the aborigines and their language . Finally , however , the arrangements were made and we drove out into the bush in a Land Rover . We followed the asphalt road for a few miles and then swung off onto a smaller road which was nothing more than two tire marks on the earth . The rancher went a mile down this road and then , when he reached a big red boulder , swung off the road . At once he started to glance toward the instrument panel . It took me a moment to realize what was odd about that panel : there was a gimbaled compass welded to it , which rocked gently back and forth as the Land Rover bounced about . The rancher was navigating his way across the flatland . `` Do you always navigate like this '' ? I asked . `` Damned right '' , he said . `` Once I get out on the flat I do . Some chaps that know an area well can make their way by landmarks , a tree here , a wash here , a boulder there . But if you don't know the place like the palm of your hand , you'd better use a compass and the speedometer . Two miles northeast , then five miles southwest that sort of thing . Very simple '' . He was right . The landscape kept repeating itself . I would try to memorize landmarks and saw in a half-hour that it was hopeless . Finally we approached the bivouac of the aborigines . They were camped beside a large column-shaped boulder : a man , his lubra , and two children . The sun was not yet high and all of them were in the small area of shade cast by the boulder . There was also a dog , a dingo dog . Its ribs showed , it was a yellow nondescript color , it suffered from a variety of sores , hair had scabbed off its body in patches . It lay with its head on its paws and only its eyes moving , watching us carefully . It struck me as a very bright and very malnourished dog . No one patted the dog . It was not a pet . It was a worker . `` The buggers love shade '' , the rancher said . `` I suppose because it saves them some loss of body water . They'll move around that rock all day , following the shade . During the hottest part of the day , of course , the sun comes straight down and there isn't any shade '' . We drove close to the boulder , stopped the Land Rover , and walked over toward the family . The man was leaning against the rock . He gazed away from us as we approached . He was over six feet tall and very thin . His legs were narrow and very long . Every bone and muscle in his body showed , but he did not give the appearance of starving . He had long black hair and a wispy beard . The ridges over his eyes were huge and his eyelids were half shut . There was something about his face that disturbed me and it took several seconds to realize what . It was not merely that flies were crawling over his face but his narrowed eyelids did not blink when the flies crawled into his eye sockets . A fly would crawl down the bulging forehead , into the socket of the eye , walk along the man's lashes and across the wet surface of the eyeball , and the eye did not blink . The Australian and I both were wearing insect repellent and were not badly bothered by insects , but my eyes watered as we stood watching the aborigine . I turned to look at the lubra . She remained squatting on her heels all the time we were there ; ; like the man , she was entirely naked . Her long thin arms moved in a slow rhythmical gesture over the family possessions which were placed in front of her . There were two rubbing sticks for making fire , two stones shaped roughly like knives , a woven-root container which held a few pounds of dried worms and the dead body of some rodent . There was also a long wooden spear and a woomera , a spear-throwing device which gives the spear an enormous velocity and high accuracy . There was also a boomerang , elaborately carved . Everything was burnished with sweat and grease so that all of the objects seemed to have been carved from the same material and to be ageless . The two children , both boys , wandered around the Australian and me for a few moments and then returned to their work . They squatted on their heels with their heads bent far forward , their eyes only a few inches from the ground . They had located the runway of a colony of ants and as the ants came out of the ground , the boys picked them up , one at a time , and pinched them dead . The tiny bodies , dropped onto a dry leaf , made a pile as big as a small apple . The odor here was more powerful than that which surrounded the town aborigines . The smell at first was more surprising than unpleasant . It was also subtly familiar , for it was the odor of the human body , but multiplied innumerable times because of the fact that the aborigines never bathed . One's impulse is to say that the smell was a stink and unpleasant . But that is a cliche and a dishonest one . The smell is sexual , but so powerfully so that a civilized nose must deny it . Their skin was covered with a thin coating of sweat and dirt which had almost the consistency of a second skin . They roll at night in ashes to keep warm and their second skin has a light dusty cast to it . In spots such as the elbows and knees the second skin is worn off and I realized the aborigines were much darker than they appeared ; ; as if the coating of sweat , dirt , and ashes were a cosmetic . The boys had beautiful dark eyes and unlike their father they brushed constantly at the flies and blinked their eyes . `` That smell is something , eh , mate '' ? The Australian asked . `` They swear that every person smells different and every family smells different from every other . At the corroborees , when they get to dancing and sweating , you'll see them rubbing up against a man who's supposed to have a specially good smell . Idje , here '' , and he nodded at the man , `` is said to have great odor . The stink is all the same to me , but I really think they can make one another out blindfolded '' . `` Here , Idje , you fella like tabac '' ? He said sharply . Idje still stared over our shoulders at the horizon . The Australian stopped trying to talk a pidgin I could understand , and spoke strange words from deep in his chest . It was a fortunate time in which to build , for the seventeenth century was a great period in Persian art . The architects , the tile and carpet makers , the potters , painters , calligraphers , and metalsmiths worked through Abbas's reign and those of his successors to enrich the city . Travelers entering from the desert were confounded by what must have seemed an illusion : a great garden filled with nightingales and roses , cut by canals and terraced promenades , studded with water tanks of turquoise tile in which were reflected the glistening blue curves of a hundred domes . At the heart of all of this was the square , which one such traveler declared to be `` as spacious , as pleasant and aromatick a Market as any in the Universe '' . In time Isfahan came to be known as `` half the world '' , Isfahan nisf-i-jahan . In the early eighteenth century this fantastic city , then the size of London , started to decline . The Afghans invaded ; ; the Safavids fell from power ; ; the capital went elsewhere ; ; the desert encroached . Isfahan became more of a legend than a place , and now it is for many people simply a name to which they attach their notions of old Persia and sometimes of the East . They think of it as a kind of spooky museum in which they may half see and half imagine the old splendor . Those who actually get there find that it isn't spooky at all but as brilliant as a tile in sunlight . But even for them it remains a museum , or perhaps it would be more accurate to say a tomb , a tomb in which Persia lies well preserved but indeed dead . Everyone is ready to grant the Persians their history , but almost no one is willing to acknowledge their present . It seems that for Persia , and especially for this city , there are only two times : the glorious past and the corrupt , depressing , sterile present . The one apparent connection between the two is a score of buildings which somehow or other have survived and which naturally enough are called `` historical monuments '' . However , just as all the buildings have not fallen and flowed back to their original mud , so the values which wanted them and saw that they were built have not all disappeared . The values and talents which made the tile and the dome , the rug , the poem and the miniature , continue in certain social institutions which rise above the ordinary life of this city , as the great buildings rise above blank walls and dirty lanes . Often , too , the social institutions are housed in these pavilions and palaces and bridges , for these great structures are not simply `` historical monuments '' ; ; they are the places where Persians live . The promenade , for example , continues to take place on the Chahar Bagh , a mile-long garden of plane and poplar trees that now serves as the city's principal street . It takes place as well along the terraces and through the arcades of the Khaju bridge , and also in the gardens of the square . On Fridays , the day when many Persians relax with poetry , talk , and a samovar , people do not , it is true , stream into Chehel Sotun -- a pavilion and garden built by Shah Abbas 2 , in the seventeenth century -- but they do retire into hundreds of pavilions throughout the city and up the river valley , which are smaller , more humble copies of the former . And of course religious life continues to center in the more famous mosques , and commercial life -- very much a social institution -- in the bazaar . Those three other great activities of the Persians , the bath , the teahouse , and the zur khaneh ( the latter a kind of club in which a leader and a group of men in an octagonal pit move through a rite of calisthenics , dance , chanted poetry , and music ) , do not take place in buildings to which entrance tickets are sold , but some of them occupy splendid examples of Persian domestic architecture : long , domed , chalk-white rooms with daises of turquoise tile , their end walls cut through to the orchards and the sky by open arches . But more important , and the thing which the casual traveler and the blind sojourner often do not see , is that these places and activities are often the settings in which Persians exercise their extraordinary aesthetic sensibilities . Water , air , fruit , poetry , music , the human form -- these things are important to Persians , and they experience them with an intense and discriminating awareness . I should like , by the way , to make it clear that I am not using the word `` Persians '' carelessly . I don't mean a few aesthetes who play about with sensations , like a young prince in a miniature dabbling his hand in a pool . These things are important to almost all Persians and perhaps most important to the most ordinary . The men crying love poems in an orchard on any summer's night are as often as not the lutihaw , mustachioed toughs who spend most of their lives in and out of the local prisons , brothels , and teahouses . A few months ago it was a fairly typical landlord who in the dead of night lugged me up a mountainside to drink from a spring famous in the neighborhood for its clarity and flavor . Not long ago an acquaintance , a slick-headed water rat of a lad up from the maw of the city , stood on the balcony puffing his first cigarette in weeks . The air , he said , was just right ; ; a cigarette would taste particularly good . I really didn't know what he meant . It was a nice day , granted . But he knew ; ; he sniffed the air and licked it on his lip and knew as a vintner knows a vintage . The natural world then , plus poetry and some kinds of art , receives from the most ordinary of Persians a great deal of attention . The line of an eyebrow , the color of the skin , a ghazal from Hafiz , the purity of spring water , the long afternoon among the boughs which crowd the upper story of a pavilion -- these things are noticed , judged , and valued . Nowhere in Isfahan is this rich aesthetic life of the Persians shown so well as during the promenade at the Khaju bridge . There has probably always been a bridge of some sort at the southeastern corner of the city . For one thing , there is a natural belt of rock across the river bed ; ; for another , it was here that one of the old caravan routes came in . It was to provide a safe and spacious crossing for these caravans , and also to make a pleasance for the city , that Shah Abbas 2 , in about 1657 built , of sun-baked brick , tile , and stone , the present bridge . It is a splendid structure . From upstream it looks like a long arcaded box laid across the river ; ; from downstream , where the water level is much lower , it is a high , elaborately facaded pavilion . The top story contains more than thirty alcoves separated from each other by spandrels of blue and yellow tile . At either end and in the center there are bays which contain nine greater alcoves as frescoed and capacious as church apses . Here , in the old days -- when they had come to see the moon or displays of fireworks -- sat the king and his court while priests , soldiers , and other members of the party lounged in the smaller alcoves between . Below , twenty vaults tunnel through the understructure of the bridge . These are traversed by another line of vaults , and thus rooms , arched on all four sides , are formed . Down through the axis of the bridge there is a long diminishing vista like a visual echo of piers and arches , while the vaults fronting upstream and down frame the sunset and sunrise , the mountains and river pools . Here , on the hottest day , it is cool beneath the stone and fresh from the water flowing in the sluices at the bottom of the vaults . On the downstream , or `` pavilion '' , side these vaults give out onto terraces twice as wide as the bridge itself . From the terraces -- eighteen in all -- broad flights of steps descend into the water or onto still more terraces barely above the level of the river . Out of water , brick , and tile they have made far more than just a bridge . On spring and summer evenings people leave their shops and houses and walk up through the lanes of the city to the bridge . It is a great spectacle . The bridge itself rises up from the river , light-flared and enormous , like the outdoor set for an epic opera . Crowds press along the terraces , down the steps , in and out of the arcades , massing against it as though it were a fortress under siege . All kinds come to walk in the promenade : merchants from the bazaar bickering over a deal ; ; a Bakhtiari khan in a cap and hacking jacket ; ; dervishes who stand with the stillness of the blind , their eyes filmed with rheum and visions ; ; the old Kajar princes arriving in their ancient limousines ; ; students , civil servants , beggars , musicians , hawkers , and clowns . Families go out to the edge of the terraces to sit on carpets around a samovar . Below , people line the steps , as though on bleachers , to watch the sky and river . Above , in the tiled prosceniums of the alcoves , boys sing the ghazals of Hafiz and Saadi , while at the very bottom , in the vaults , the toughs and blades of the city hoot and bang their drums , drink arak , play dice , and dance . Here in an evening Persians enjoy many of the things which are important to them : poetry , water , the moon , a beautiful face . To a stranger their delight in these things may seem paradoxical , for Persians chase the golden calf as much as any people . Many of them , moreover , are beginning to complain about the scarcity of Western amusements and to ridicule the old life of the bazaar merchant , the mullah , and the peasant . Nonetheless , they take time out -- much time -- from the game of grab and these new Western experiments to go to the gardens and riverbanks . Above all , they will stop in the middle of anything , anywhere , to hear or quote some poetry . Poetry in Persian life is far more than a common ground on which -- in a society deeply fissured by antagonisms -- all may stand . It contains , in fact , their whole outlook on life . And it is expressed , at least to their taste , in a perfect form . Poetry for a Persian is nothing less than truth and beauty . In most Western cultures today these twins have been sent away to the libraries and museums . In Persia , where practically speaking there are no museums or libraries or , for that matter , hardly any books , the twins run free . It is perhaps difficult to conceive , but imagine that tonight on London bridge the Teddy boys of the East End will gather to sing Marlowe , Herrick , Shakespeare , and perhaps some lyrics of their own . That , at any rate , is what happens at the Khaju bridge . Boys and men go along the riverbank or to the alcoves in the top arcade . Here in these little rooms -- or stages arched open to the sky and river -- they choose a few lines out of the hundreds they may know and sing them according to one of the modes into which Persian music is divided . Each mode is believed to have a specific attribute -- one inducing pleasure , another generosity , another love , and so on , to include all of the emotions . The singer simply matches the poem to a mode ; ; for example , the mode of bravery to this anonymous folk poem : `` They brought me news that Spring is in the plains And Ahmad's blood the crimson tulip stains ; ; Go , tell his aged mother that her son Fought with a thousand foes , and he was one '' . Or the mode of love to this fragment by a recent poet : `` Know ye , fair folk who dwell on earth Or shall hereafter come to birth , That here , with dust upon his eyes , Iraj , the sweet-tongued singer , lies . In this true lover's tomb interred A world of love lies sepulchred . '' These songs ( practically all Persian music , for that matter ) are limited to a range of two octaves . Yet within this limitation there is an astonishing variety : design as intricate as that in the carpet or miniature , with the melodic line like the painted or woven line often flowing into an arabesque . Die Frist ist um , und wiederum verstrichen sind sieben Jahr , the Maestro quoted The Flying Dutchman , as he told of his career and wanderings , explaining that the number seven had significantly recurred in his life several times . The music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra , William Steinberg , has molded his group into a prominent musical organization , which is his life . When he added to his Pittsburgh commitments the directorship of the London Philharmonic Orchestra in 1958 , he conducted one hundred fifty concerts within nine months , `` commuting '' between the two cities . This schedule became too strenuous , even for the energetic and conscientious Mr. Steinberg . His London contract was rescinded , and now , he explains cheerfully , as a bright smile lightens his intense , mobile face , `` I conduct only one hundred and twenty concerts '' ! Our meeting took place in May , 1961 , during one of the Maestro's stop-overs in New York , before he left for Europe . As we began to converse in the lounge of his Fifth Avenue hotel , his restlessness and sensitivity to light and sound became immediately apparent . Seeking an obscure , dark , relatively quiet corner in the airy room otherwise suffused with afternoon sunshine , he asked if the soft background music could be turned off . Unfortunately , it was Muzak , which automatically is piped into the public rooms , and which nolens volens had to be endured . As he talked about himself , time and again stuffing and dragging on his pipe , Steinberg began to relax and the initial hurried feeling grew faint and was dispelled . Did he come from a musical family ? Yes : though not professional musicians , they were a music-loving family . In his native Cologne , where his mother taught him to play the piano , he was able to read notes before he learned the alphabet . She even devised a system of colors , whereby the boy could easily distinguish the different note values . When he started school at the age of five-and-a-half , he could not understand why the alphabet begins with the letter A , instead of C , as in the scale . Because , like many other children , he intensely disliked practicing Czerny Etudes , he composed his own studies . When he was eight he began violin lessons . Soon he was playing in the Cologne Municipal Orchestra , and during World War 1 , , when musicians were scarce , he joined the opera orchestra as well . Steinberg claims that these early years of orchestra participation were of invaluable help to his career . `` By observing the conductor '' , he says with a twinkle in his eyes , `` I learned how not to conduct '' . The musician ran away from school when he was fifteen , but this escapade did not save him from the Gymnasium . Simultaneously , he pursued his musical studies at the conservatory , receiving sound training in counterpoint and harmony , as well in the violin and piano . His professional career began when he was twenty ; ; he became Otto Klemperer's personal assistant at the Cologne Opera , and a year later was promoted to the position of regular conductor . Wasn't this an unusually young age to fill such a responsible post ? Yes , the Maestro assented . Had he always wished to be a conductor ? No , originally he had hoped to become a concert pianist and had even performed as such . However , when he assumed the duties of a conductor , he relinquished his career as a pianist . Five years were spent with the Cologne Opera , after which he was called to Prague by Alexander von Zemlinsky , teacher of Arnold Schonberg and Erich Korngold . In 1927 he succeeded Zemlinsky as opera director of the German Theater at Prague . During his tenure he also fulfilled guest engagements at the Berlin State Opera . Two years later he became director of the Frankfurt Opera , where he remained until he lost this position in 1933 through the rise of the Hitler regime . During these years the youthful conductor had contributed greatly to the high level of musical life in Germany . He had presented the first German performances of Puccini's Manon Lescaut and De Falla's La Vida Breve . The Frankfurt years were particularly noteworthy for his performance of Berg's Wozzek soon after the Berlin premiere under Erich Kleiber , and the world premiere of Schonberg's Von heute auf morgen . At the outset of his career , Steinberg had dedicated himself to the advancement of contemporary music by vowing to do a Schonberg work every year . In Frankfurt , too , he directed the Museum and Opera House concerts which , in addition to the standard repertoire , featured novelties like Erdmann's Piano Concerto and Mahler's Sixth Symphony . Because of the political upheaval in Germany in the 1930's , Steinberg was forced to restrict his activities to the Jewish community . Through the Frankfurt Jewish Kulturbund he began to give sonata recitals in synagogues , with Cellist Emanuel Feuermann . As more and more Jewish musicians lost their jobs with professional organizations Steinberg united them into the Frankfurt Kulturbund Orchestra , which also gave guest performances in other German cities . In 1936 he accepted the leadership of the Berlin Kulturbund . In the fall of that year the best musicians of the Berlin and Frankfurt Kulturbund orchestras joined under the combined efforts of Bronislaw Hubermann and Steinberg to become the Palestine Orchestra -- now known as the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra -- with Steinberg as founder-conductor . In 1938 , at the insistence of Arturo Toscanini , Steinberg left Germany for the United States , by way of Switzerland . After he had spent the first three years in New York as associate conductor , at Toscanini's invitation , of the NBC Orchestra , he made numerous guest appearances throughout the United States and Latin America . In 1945 he became conductor of the Buffalo Philharmonic . Seven years later he was asked to become director of the Pittsburgh Symphony . Since 1944 he has also conducted regularly at the San Francisco Opera , where he made his debut with a memorable performance of Verdi's Falstaff . In recent years he has traveled widely in Europe , conducting in Italy , France , Austria , and Switzerland . He returned to Germany for the first time in 1953 , where he has since conducted in Cologne , Frankfurt , and Berlin . Where in Europe was he going now ? First of all , to Italy for a short vacation -- Forte Dei Marmi , a place he loves . Since it is not far from Viareggio , he will visit Puccini's house , as he never fails to do , to pay his respects to the memory of the composer of La Boheme , which he considers one of Puccini's masterpieces . Steinberg spoke with warmth and enthusiasm about Italy : `` Rome is my second home . I consider it the center of the world and make it a point to be there once a year '' . He will conduct two concerts at the Accademia Di Santa Cecilia , as well as concerts in Munich and Cologne . `` Then I return to the United States for engagements at the Hollywood Bowl and in Philadelphia '' , he added . The forthcoming season in Pittsburgh also promises to be of unusual interest . There will be premieres of new works , made possible through Ford Foundation commissions : Carlisle Floyd's Mystery , with Phyllis Curtin as soprano soloist . Other world premieres will be Gardner Read's Third Symphony and Burle Marx's Samba Concertante . `` And next year we will do -- also a Ford commission -- a piano concerto by Elliott Carter , with Jacob Lateiner as soloist . Of course , I shall conduct Mahler and Bruckner works in the coming season , as usual . We'll play Bruckner's Fifth Symphony in the original version , and Mahler's Seventh -- the least accessible , known , and played of Mahler's works . My Pittsburghers have become real addicts to Mahler and Bruckner '' . He added that he also stresses the works of these favorite masters on tour , especially Mahler's First and Fourth symphonies , and Das Lied Von der Erde , and Bruckner's Sixth -- which is rarely played -- and Seventh . Bruckner's Eighth he refers to as `` my travel symphony '' . He recalled that in California after a critic had attacked him for `` still trying to sell Bruckner to the Americans '' , the public's response at the next concert was a standing ovation . `` Now that Bruno Walter is virtually in retirement and my dear friend Dimitri Mitropoulos is no longer with us , I am probably the only one -- with the possible exception of Leonard Bernstein -- who has this special affinity for and champions the works of Bruckner and Mahler '' . Since he introduces so much modern music , I could not resist asking how he felt about it . `` There was always and at all times a contemporary music and it expresses the era in which it was created . But I usually stick to the old phrase : ' Ich habe ein Amt , aber keine Meinung ( I hold an office , but I do not feel entitled to have an opinion ) . I consider it to be my job to expose the public to what is being written today '' . With all his musical activities , did he have the time and inclination to do anything else ? He had just paid a brief visit to the Frick Collection to admire his favorite paintings by Rembrandt and Franz Hals . He was not enthusiastic over the newly acquired Claude Lorrain , but reminisced with pleasure over a Poussin exhibit he had been able to see in Paris a year ago . And how did he feel about modern art ? Again Steinberg was cautious and replied with a smile that he was not exposed to it enough to hazard comments . `` As my wife puts it '' , he said , again with a twinkle in his eyes , `` all you know is your music . But after all , you never learned anything else '' ! What did he do for relaxation ? Like his late colleague , Mitropoulos , he reads mystery stories , in particular Sir Arthur Conan Doyle . He cited Heine and Stendhal as favorites in literature . But his prime interest , apart from music , he insisted seriously , was his family -- his wife , daughter and son . At the moment he was excited about his son's having received the Prix De Rome in archaeology and was looking forward to being present this summer at the excavation of an Etruscan tomb . `` Both children are musical and my wife is a music lover of unfailing instinct and judgement '' . `` Is the attitude of German youth comparable to that of `` the angry young men ' of England '' ? Was the topic for a round-table discussion at the Bayerische Rundfunk in Munich . I was chairman , the only not youthful participant . Since attack serves to stimulate interest in broadcasts , I added to my opening statement a sentence in which I claimed that German youth seemed to lack the enthusiasm which is a necessary ingredient of anger , and might be classified as uninterested and bored rather than angry . I was far from convinced of the truth of my statement , but could not think of anything that might evoke responses more quickly . `` It is easy for you to talk '' ; ; countered a twenty year old law student , `` you travel around the world . We would like to do that too '' . `` But you want a job guaranteed when you return '' , I continued my attack . `` You must have some security '' , said a young clerk . When I mentioned that for my first long voyage I did not even have the money for the return fare , but had trusted to luck that I would earn a sufficient amount , the young people looked at me doubtingly . One girl expressed what was obviously in their minds . `` Would you advise us to act the same way ? You might have failed . I think it is rather foolhardy to trust to luck '' . Others mentioned that I might have had to ask friends or even strangers for help and that to be stranded in a foreign country without sufficient funds did not contribute to international understanding . The debate needed no additional controversy and soon I could ask each individually what he expected from life , what his hopes were and what his fears . Though the four boys and two girls , the youngest nineteen years of age , the oldest twenty-four , came from varying backgrounds and had different professional and personal interests , there was surprising agreement among them . What they wished for most was security ; ; what they feared most was war or political instability in their own country . The ideal home , they agreed , would be a small private house or a city apartment of four to five rooms , just enough for a family consisting of husband , wife , and two children . No one wanted a larger family or no children , and none hoped for a castle or said that living in less settled circumstances would be satisfactory . All expressed interest in world affairs but no one offered to make any sacrifices to satisfy this interest . Once again , as in the days of the Founding Fathers , America faces a stern test . That test , as President Kennedy forthrightly depicted it in his State of the Union message , will determine `` whether a nation organized and governed such as ours can endure '' . It is well then that in this hour both of `` national peril '' and of `` national opportunity '' we can take counsel with the men who made the nation . Incapable of self-delusion , the Founding Fathers found the crisis of their time to be equally grave , and yet they had confidence that America would surmount it and that a republic of free peoples would prosper and serve as an example to a world aching for liberty . Seven Founders -- George Washington , Benjamin Franklin , John Adams , Thomas Jefferson , Alexander Hamilton , James Madison and John Jay -- determined the destinies of the new nation . In certain respects , their task was incomparably greater than ours today , for there was nobody before them to show them the way . As Madison commented to Jefferson in 1789 , `` We are in a wilderness without a single footstep to guide us . Our successors will have an easier task '' . They thought of themselves , to use Jefferson's words , as `` the Argonauts '' who had lived in `` the Heroic Age '' . Accordingly , they took special pains to preserve their papers as essential sources for posterity . Their writings assume more than dramatic or patriotic interest because of their conviction that the struggle in which they were involved was neither selfish nor parochial but , rather , as Washington in his last wartime circular reminded his fellow countrymen , that `` with our fate will the destiny of unborn millions be involved '' . Strong men with strong opinions , frank to the point of being refreshingly indiscreet , the Founding Seven were essentially congenial minds , and their agreements with each other were more consequential than their differences . Even though in most cases the completion of the definitive editions of their writings is still years off , enough documentation has already been assembled to warrant drawing a new composite profile of the leadership which performed the heroic dual feats of winning American independence and founding a new nation . Before merging them into a common profile it is well to remember that their separate careers were extraordinary . Certainly no other seven American statesmen from any later period achieved so much in so concentrated a span of years . Eldest of the seven , Benjamin Franklin , a New Englander transplanted to Philadelphia , wrote the most dazzling success story in our history . The young printer's apprentice achieved greatness in a half-dozen different fields , as editor and publisher , scientist , inventor , philanthropist and statesman . Author of the Albany Plan Of Union , which , had it been adopted , might have avoided the Revolution , he fought the colonists' front-line battles in London , negotiated the treaty of alliance with France and the peace that ended the war , headed the state government of Pennsylvania , and exercised an important moderating influence at the Federal Convention . On a military mission for his native Virginia the youthful George Washington touched off the French and Indian War , then guarded his colony's frontier as head of its militia . Commanding the Continental Army for six long years of the Revolution , he was the indispensable factor in the ultimate victory . Retiring to his beloved Mount Vernon , he returned to preside over the Federal Convention , and was the only man in history to be unanimously elected President . During his two terms the Constitution was tested and found workable , strong national policies were inaugurated , and the traditions and powers of the Presidential office firmly fixed . John Adams fashioned much of pre-Revolutionary radical ideology , wrote the constitution of his home state of Massachusetts , negotiated , with Franklin and Jay , the peace with Britain and served as our first Vice President and our second President . His political opponent and lifetime friend , Thomas Jefferson , achieved immortality through his authorship of the Declaration of Independence , but equally notable were the legal and constitutional reforms he instituted in his native Virginia , his role as father of our territorial system , and his acquisition of the Louisiana Territory during his first term as President . During the greater part of Jefferson's career he enjoyed the close collaboration of a fellow Virginian , James Madison , eight years his junior . The active sponsor of Jefferson's measure for religious liberty in Virginia , Madison played the most influential single role in the drafting of the Constitution and in securing its ratification in Virginia , founded the first political party in American history , and , as Jefferson's Secretary of State and his successor in the Presidency , guided the nation through the troubled years of our second war with Britain . If Franklin was an authentic genius , then Alexander Hamilton , with his exceptional precocity , consuming energy , and high ambition , was a political prodigy . His revolutionary pamphlets , published when he was only 19 , quickly brought him to the attention of the patriot leaders . Principal author of `` The Federalist '' , he swung New York over from opposition to the Constitution to ratification almost single-handedly . His collaboration with Washington , begun when he was the general's aide during the Revolution , was resumed when he entered the first Cabinet as Secretary of the Treasury . His bold fiscal program and his broad interpretation of the Constitution stand as durable contributions . Less dazzling than Hamilton , less eloquent than Jefferson , John Jay commands an equally high rank among the Founding Fathers . He served as president of the Continental Congress . He played the leading role in negotiating the treaty with Great Britain that ended the Revolution , and directed America's foreign affairs throughout the Confederation period . As first Chief Justice , his strong nationalist opinions anticipated John Marshall . He ended his public career as a two-term governor of New York . These Seven Founders constituted an intellectual and social elite , the most respectable and disinterested leadership any revolution ever confessed . Their social status was achieved in some cases by birth , as with Washington , Jefferson and Jay ; ; in others by business and professional acumen , as with Franklin and Adams , or , in Hamilton's case , by an influential marriage . Unlike so many of the power-starved intellectuals in underdeveloped nations of our own day , they commanded both prestige and influence before the Revolution started . As different physically as the tall , angular Jefferson was from the chubby , rotund Adams , the seven were striking individualists . Ardent , opinionated , even obstinate , they were amazingly articulate , wrote their own copy , and were masters of phrasemaking . Capable of enduring friendships , they were also stout controversialists , who could write with a drop of vitriol on their pens . John Adams dismissed John Dickinson , who voted against the Declaration of Independence , as `` a certain great fortune and piddling genius '' . Washington castigated his critic , General Conway , as being capable of `` all the meanness of intrigue to gratify the absurd resentment of disappointed vanity '' . And Hamilton , who felt it `` a religious duty '' to oppose Aaron Burr's political ambitions , would have been a better actuarial risk had he shown more literary restraint . The Seven Founders were completely dedicated to the public service . Madison once remarked : `` My life has been so much a public one '' , a comment which fits the careers of the other six . Franklin retired from editing and publishing at the age of 42 , and for the next forty-two years devoted himself to public , scientific , and philanthropic interests . Washington never had a chance to work for an extended stretch at the occupation he loved best , plantation management . He served as Commander in Chief during the Revolution without compensation . John Adams took to heart the advice given him by his legal mentor , Jeremiah Gridley , to `` pursue the study of the law , rather than the gain of it '' . In taking account of seventeen years of law practice , Adams concluded that `` no lawyer in America ever did so much business as I did '' and `` for so little profit '' . When the Revolution broke out , he , along with Jefferson and Jay , abandoned his career at the bar , with considerable financial sacrifice . Hamilton , poorest of the seven , gave up a brilliant law practice to enter Washington's Cabinet . While he was handling the multi-million-dollar funding operations of the Government he had to resort to borrowing small sums from friends . `` If you can conveniently let me have twenty dollars '' , he wrote one friend in 1791 when he was Secretary of the Treasury . To support his large family Hamilton went back to the law after each spell of public service . Talleyrand passed his New York law office one night on the way to a party . Hamilton was bent over his desk , drafting a legal paper by the light of a candle . The Frenchman was astonished . `` I have just come from viewing a man who had made the fortune of his country , but now is working all night in order to support his family '' , he reflected . All seven combined ardent devotion to the cause of revolution with a profound respect for legality . John Adams asserted in the Continental Congress' Declaration of Rights that the demands of the colonies were in accordance with their charters , the British Constitution and the common law , and Jefferson appealed in the Declaration of Independence `` to the tribunal of the world '' for support of a revolution justified by `` the laws of nature and of nature's God '' . They fought hard , but they were forgiving to former foes , and sought to prevent vindictive legislatures from confiscating Tory property in violation of the Treaty of 1783 . This sense of moderation and fairness is superbly exemplified in an exchange of letters between John Jay and a Tory refugee , Peter Van Schaack . Jay had participated in the decision that exiled his old friend Van Schaack . Yet when , at war's end , the ex-Tory made the first move to resume correspondence , Jay wrote him from Paris , where he was negotiating the peace settlement : `` As an independent American I considered all who were not for us , and you amongst the rest , as against us , yet be assured that John Jay never ceased to be the friend of Peter Van Schaack '' . The latter in turn assured him that `` were I arraigned at the bar , and you my judge , I should expect to stand or fall only by the merits of my cause '' . All seven recognized that independence was but the first step toward building a nation . `` We have now a national character to establish '' , Washington wrote in 1783 . `` Think continentally '' , Hamilton counseled the young nation . This new force , love of country , super-imposed upon -- if not displacing -- affectionate ties to one's own state , was epitomized by Washington . His first inaugural address speaks of `` my country whose voice I can never hear but with veneration and love '' . All sought the fruition of that nationalism in a Federal Government with substantial powers . Save Jefferson , all participated in the framing or ratification of the Federal Constitution . They supported it , not as a perfect instrument , but as the best obtainable . Historians have traditionally regarded the great debates of the Seventeen Nineties as polarizing the issues of centralized vs. limited government , with Hamilton and the nationalists supporting the former and Jefferson and Madison upholding the latter position . The state's rights position was formulated by Jefferson and Madison in the Kentucky and Virginia Resolves , but in their later careers as heads of state the two proved themselves better Hamiltonians than Jeffersonians . In purchasing Louisiana , Jefferson had to adopt Hamilton's broad construction of the Constitution , and so did Madison in advocating the rechartering of Hamilton's bank , which he had so strenuously opposed at its inception , and in adopting a Hamiltonian protective tariff . Indeed , the old Jeffersonians were far more atune to the Hamilton-oriented Whigs than they were to the Jacksonian Democrats . When , in 1832 , the South Carolina nullifiers adopted the principle of state interposition which Madison had advanced in his old Virginia Resolve , they elicited no encouragement from that senior statesman . In his political testament , `` Advice To My Country '' , penned just before his death , Madison expressed the wish `` that the Union of the States be cherished and perpetuated . Let the open enemy to it be regarded as a Pandora with her box opened ; ; and the disguised one , as the serpent creeping with his deadly wiles into Paradise '' . Tobacco Road is dead . Long live Tobacco Road . Nostalgic Yankee readers of Erskine Caldwell are today informed by proud Georgians that Tobacco Road is buried beneath a four-lane super highway , over which travel each day suburbanite businessmen more concerned with the Dow-Jones average than with the cotton crop . Thus we are compelled to face the urbanization of the South -- an urbanization which , despite its dramatic and overwhelming effects upon the Southern culture , has been utterly ignored by the bulk of Southern writers . Indeed , it seems that only in today's Southern fiction does Tobacco Road , with all the traditional trimmings of sowbelly and cornbread and mint juleps , continue to live -- but only as a weary , overexploited phantom . Those writers known collectively as the `` Southern school '' have received accolades from even those critics least prone to eulogize ; ; according to many critics , in fact , the South has led the North in literature since the Civil War , both quantitatively and qualitatively . Such writers as William Faulkner and Robert Penn Warren have led the field of somewhat less important writers in a sort of post-bellum renaissance . It is interesting , however , that despite this strong upsurge in Southern writing , almost none of the writers has forsaken the firmly entrenched concept of the white-suited big-daddy colonel sipping a mint julep as he silently recounts the revenue from the season's cotton and tobacco crops ; ; of the stereotyped Negro servants chanting hymns as they plow the fields ; ; of these and a host of other antiquated legends that deny the South its progressive leaps of the past century . This is not to say that the South is no longer agrarian ; ; such a statement would be the rankest form of oversimplification . But the South is , and has been for the past century , engaged in a wide-sweeping urbanization which , oddly enough , is not reflected in its literature . In 1900 the South was only 15% urban ; ; in 1950 it had become 47.1% urban . In a mere half-century the South has more than tripled its urban status . There is a New South emerging , a South losing the folksy traditions of an agrarian society with the rapidity of an avalanche -- especially within recent decades . As the New South snowballs toward further urbanization , it becomes more and more homogeneous with the North -- a tendency which Willard Thorp terms `` Yankeefication '' , as evidenced in such cities as Charlotte , Birmingham , and Houston . It is said that , even at the present stage of Southern urbanization , such a city as Atlanta is not distinctly unlike Columbus or Trenton . Undoubtedly even the old Southern stalwart Richmond has felt the new wind : William Styron mentions in his latest novel an avenue named for Bankhead McGruder , a Civil War general , now renamed , in typical California fashion , `` Buena Vista Terrace '' . The effects of television and other mass media are erasing regional dialects and localisms with a startling force . As for progress , the `` backward South '' can boast of Baton Rouge , which increased its population between 1940 and 1950 by two hundred and sixty-two percent , to 126,000 , the second largest growth of the period for all cities over 25,000 . The field , then , is ripe for new Southerners to step to the fore and write of this twentieth-century phenomenon , the Southern Yankeefication : the new urban economy , the city-dweller , the pains of transition , the labor problems ; ; the list is , obviously , endless . But these sources have not been tapped . Truman Capote is still reveling in Southern Gothicism , exaggerating the old Southern legends into something beautiful and grotesque , but as unreal as -- or even more unreal than -- yesterday . William Styron , while facing the changing economy with a certain uneasy reluctance , insists he is not to be classified as a Southern writer and yet includes traditional Southern concepts in everything he publishes . Even the great god Faulkner , the South's one probable contender for literary immortality , has little concerned himself with these matters ; ; such are simply not within his bounded province . Where are the writers to treat these changes ? Has the agrarian tradition become such an addiction that the switch to urbanism is somehow dreaded or unwanted ? Perhaps present writers hypnotically cling to the older order because they consider it useful and reliable through repeated testings over the decades . Lacking the pioneer spirit necessary to write of a new economy , these writers seem to be contenting themselves with an old one that is now as defunct as Confederate money . An example of the changes which have crept over the Southern region may be seen in the Southern Negro's quest for a position in the white-dominated society , a problem that has been reflected in regional fiction especially since 1865 . Today the Negro must discover his role in an industrialized South , which indicates that the racial aspect of the Southern dilemma hasn't changed radically , but rather has gradually come to be reflected in this new context , this new coat of paint . The Negro faces as much , if not more , difficulty in fitting himself into an urban economy as he did in an agrarian one . This represents a gradual change in an ever-present social problem . But there have been abrupt changes as well : the sit-ins , the picket lines , the bus strikes -- all of these were unheard-of even ten years ago . Today's evidence , such as the fact that only three Southern states ( South Carolina , Alabama and Mississippi ) still openly defy integration , would have astounded many of yesterday's Southerners into speechlessness . Other examples of gradual changes that have affected the Negro have been his moving up , row by row , in the buses ; ; his requesting , and often getting , higher wages , better working conditions , better schools -- changes that were slowly emerging even before the Supreme Court decision of 1954 . Then came this decision , which sped the process of gaining equality ( or perhaps hindered it ; ; only historical evolution will determine which ) : an abrupt change . Since 1954 the Negro's desire for social justice has led to an ironically anarchical rebellion . He has frequently refused to move from white lunch counters , refused to obey local laws which he considers unjust , while in other cases he has appealed to federal laws . This bold self-assertion , after decades of humble subservience , is indeed a twentieth-century phenomenon , an abrupt change in the Southern way of existence . A new order is thrusting itself into being . A new South is emerging after the post-bellum years of hesitation , uncertainty , and lack of action from the Negro in defining his new role in the amorphously defined socio-political organizations of the white man . The modern Negro has not made a decisive debut into Southern fiction . It is clear that , while most writers enjoy picturing the Negro as a woolly-headed , humble old agrarian who mutters `` yassuhs '' and `` sho' nufs '' with blissful deference to his white employer ( or , in Old South terms , `` massuh '' ) , this stereotype is doomed to become in reality as obsolete as Caldwell's Lester . While there may still be many Faulknerian Lucas Beauchamps scattered through the rural South , such men appear to be a vanishing breed . Writers openly admit that the Negro is easier to write than the white man ; ; but they obviously mean by this , not a Negro personality , but a Negro type . Presenting an individualized Negro character , it would seem , is one of the most difficult assignments a Southern writer could tackle ; ; and the success of such an endeavor is , as suggested above , glaringly rare . Just as the Negro situation points up the gradual and abrupt changes affecting Southern life , it also points up the non-representation of urbanism in Southern literature . The book concerned with the Negro's role in an urban society is rare indeed ; ; recently only Keith Wheeler's novel , Peaceable Lane , has openly faced the problem . All but the most rabid of Confederate flag wavers admit that the Old Southern tradition is defunct in actuality and sigh that its passing was accompanied by the disappearance of many genteel and aristocratic traditions of the reputedly languid ante-bellum way of life . Many earlier writers , mourning the demise of the old order , tended to romanticize and exaggerate this `` gracious Old South '' imagery , creating such lasting impressions as Margaret Mitchell's `` Tara '' Plantation . Modern writers , who are supposed to keep their fingers firmly upon the pulse of their subjects , insist upon drawing out this legend , prolonging its burial , when it well deserves a rest after the overexploitation of the past century . Perhaps these writers have been too deeply moved by this romanticizing ; ; but they can hardly deny that , exaggerated or not , the old panorama is dead . As John T. Westbrook says in his article , `` Twilight Of Southern Regionalism '' ( Southwest Review , Winter 1957 ) : `` The miasmal mausoleum where an Old South , already too minutely autopsied in prose and poetry , should be left to rest in peace , forever dead and ( let us fervently hope ) forever done with '' . Westbrook further bemoans the Southern writers' creation of an unreal image of their homeland , which is too readily assimilated by both foreign readers and visiting Yankees : `` Our northerner is suspicious of all this crass evidence ( of urbanization ) presented to his senses . It bewilders and befuddles him . He is too deeply steeped in William Faulkner and Robert Penn Warren . The fumes of progress are in his nose and the bright steel of industry towers before his eyes , but his heart is away in Yoknapatawpha County with razorback hogs and night riders . On this trip to the South he wants , above all else , to sniff the effluvium of backwoods-and-sand-hill subhumanity and to see at least one barn burn at midnight '' . Obviously , such a Northern tourist's purpose is somewhat akin to a child's experience with Disneyland : he wants to see a world of make-believe . In the meantime , while the South has been undergoing this phenomenal modernization that is so disappointing to the curious Yankee , Southern writers have certainly done little to reflect and promote their region's progress . Willard Thorp , in his new book , American Writing In The Twentieth Century , observes , quite validly it seems : `` Certain subjects are conspicuously absent or have been only lightly touched . No Southern novelist has done for Atlanta or Birmingham what Herrick , Dreiser , and Farrell did for Chicago or Dos Passos did for New York . There are almost no fictional treatments of the industrialized south '' . Not a single Southern author , major or minor , has made the urban problems of an urban South his primary source material . Faulkner , for one , appears to be safe from the accusing fingers of all assailants in this regard . Faulkner culminates the Southern legend perhaps more masterfully than it has ever been , or could ever be , done . He has made it his , and his it remains , irrevocably . He treats it with a mythological , universal application . As his disciples boast , even though his emphasis is elsewhere , Faulkner does show his awareness of the changing order of the South quite keenly , as can be proven by a quick recalling of his Sartoris and Snopes families . Even two decades ago in Go Down , Moses Faulkner was looking to the more urban future with a glimmer of hope that through its youth and its new way of life the South might be reborn and the curse of slavery erased from its soil . Yet his concern even here is with a slowly changing socio-economic order in general , and he never deals with such specific aspects of this change as the urban and industrial impact . Faulkner traces , in his vast and overpowering saga of Yoknapatawpha County , the gradual changes which seep into the South , building layer upon layer of minute , subtle innovation which eventually tend largely to hide the Old Way . Thus Faulkner reminds us , and wisely , that the `` new '' South has gradually evolved out of the Old South , and consequently its agrarian roots persist . Yet he presents a realm of source material which may well serve other writers if not himself : the problems with which a New South must grapple in groping through a blind adolescence into the maturity of urbanization . With new mechanization the modern farmer must perform the work of six men : a machine stands between the agrarian and his soil . The thousands of city migrants who desert the farms yearly must readjust with even greater stress and tension : the sacred wilderness is gradually surrendering to suburbs and research parks and industrial areas . Another element to concern the choreographer is that of the visual devices of the theatre . Most avant-garde creators , true to their interest in the self-sufficiency of pure movement , have tended to dress their dancers in simple lines and solid colors ( often black ) and to give them a bare cyclorama for a setting . But Robert Rauschenberg , the neo-dadaist artist , has collaborated with several of them . He has designed a matching backdrop and costumes of points of color on white for Mr. Cunningham's Summerspace , so that dancers and background merge into a shimmering unity . For Mr. Taylor's Images And Reflections she made some diaphanous tents that alternately hide and reveal the performer , and a girl's cape lined with grass . Mr. Nikolais has made a distinctive contribution to the arts of costume and decor . In fact , he calls his productions dance-theatre works of motion , shape , light , and sound . To raise the dancer out of his personal , pedestrian self , Mr. Nikolais has experimented with relating him to a larger , environmental orbit . He began with masks to make the dancer identify himself with the creature he appeared to be . He went on to use objects -- hoops , poles , capes -- which he employed as extensions of the body of the dancer , who moved with them . The depersonalization continued as the dancer was further metamorphosed by the play of lights upon his figure . In each case , the object , the color , even the percussive sounds of the electronic score were designed to become part of the theatrical being of the performer . The dancer who never loosens her hold on a parasol , begins to feel that it is part of herself . Or , clad from head to toe in fabric stretched over a series of hoops , the performer may well lose his sense of self in being a `` finial '' . As the dancer is depersonalized , his accouterments are animized , and the combined elements give birth to a new being . From this being come new movement ideas that utilize dancer and property as a single unit . Thus , the avant-garde choreographers have extended the scope of materials available for dance composition . But , since they have rejected both narrative and emotional continuity , how are they to unify the impressive array of materials at their disposal ? Some look deliberately to devices used by creators in the other arts and apply corresponding methods to their own work . Others , less consciously but quite probably influenced by the trends of the times , experiment with approaches that parallel those of the contemporary poet , painter , and musician . An approach that has appealed to some choreographers is reminiscent of Charles Olson's statement of the process of projective verse : `` one perception must immediately and directly lead to a further perception '' . The creator trusts his intuition to lead him along a path that has internal validity because it mirrors the reality of his experience . He disdains external restrictions -- conventional syntax , traditional metre . The unit of form is determined subjectively : `` the Heart , by the way of the Breath , to the Line '' . The test of form is fidelity to the experience , a gauge also accepted by the abstract expressionist painters . An earlier but still influential school of painting , surrealism , had suggested the way of dealing with the dream experience , that event in which seemingly incongruous objects are linked together through the curious associations of the subconscious . The resulting picture might appear a maze of restless confusions and contradictions , but it is more true to life than a portrait of an artificially contrived order . The contemporary painter tends to depict not the concrete objects of his experience but their essences as revealed in abstractions of their lines , colors , masses , and energies . He is still concerned , however , with a personal event . He accepts the accidents of his brushwork because they provide evidence of the vitality of the experience of creation . The work must be true to both the physical and the spiritual character of the experience . Some painters have less interest in the experience of the moment , with its attendant urgencies and ambiguities , than in looking beyond the flux of particular impressions to a higher , more serene level of truth . Rather than putting their trust in ephemeral sensations they seek form in the stable relationships of pure design , which symbolize an order more real than the disorder of the perceptual world . The concept remains subjective . But in this approach it is the artist's ultimate insight , rather than his immediate impressions , that gives form to the work . Others look to more objective devices of order . The musician employing the serial technique of composition establishes a mathematical system of rotations that , once set in motion , determines the sequence of pitches and even of rhythms and intensities . The composer may reverse or invert the order of his original set of intervals ( or rhythms or dynamic changes ) . He may even alter the pattern by applying a scheme of random numbers . But he cannot order his elements by will , either rational or inspired . The system works as an impersonal mechanism . Musicians who use the chance method also exclude subjective control of formal development . Again , the composer must select his own materials . But a tossing of coins , with perhaps the added safeguard of reference to the oracles of the I Ching , the Chinese Book Of Changes , dictates the handling of the chosen materials . Avant-garde choreographers , seeking new forms of continuity for their new vocabulary of movements , have turned to similar approaches . Some let dances take their form from the experience of creation . According to Katherine Litz , `` the becoming , the process of realization , is the dance '' . The process stipulates that the choreographer sense the quality of the initial movement he has discovered and that he feel the rightness of the quality that is to follow it . The sequence may involve a sharp contrast : for example , a quiet meditative sway of the body succeeded by a violent leap ; ; or it may involve more subtle distinctions : the sway may be gradually minimized or enlarged , its rhythmic emphasis may be slightly modified , or it may be transferred to become a movement of only the arms or the head . Even the least alteration will change the quality . An exploration of these possible relationships constitutes the process of creation and thereby gives form to the dance . The approach to the depiction of the experience of creation may be analytic , as it is for Miss Litz , or spontaneous , as it is for Merle Marsicano . She , too , is concerned with `` the becoming , the process of realization '' , but she does not think in terms of subtle variations of spatial or temporal patterns . The design is determined emotionally : `` I must reach into myself for the spring that will send me catapulting recklessly into the chaos of event with which the dance confronts me '' . Looking back , Miss Marsicano feels that her ideas may have been influenced by those of Jackson Pollock . At one time she felt impelled to make dances that `` moved all over the stage '' , much as Pollock's paintings move violently over the full extent of the canvas . But her conscious need was to break away from constricting patterns of form , a need to let the experience shape itself . Midi Garth also believes in subjective continuity that begins with the feeling engendered by an initial movement . It may be a free front-back swing of the leg , leading to a sideways swing of the arm that develops into a turn and the sensation of taking off from the ground . This became a dance called Prelude To Flight . A pervading quality of free lyricism and a building from turns close to the ground towards jumps into the air gives the work its central focus . Alwin Nikolais objects to art as an outpouring of personal emotion . He seeks to make his dancers more `` godlike '' by relating them to the impersonal elements of shape , light , color , and sound . If his dancers are sometimes made to look as if they might be creatures from Mars , this is consistent with his intention of placing them in the orbit of another world , a world in which they are freed of their pedestrian identities . It is through the metamorphosed dancer that the germ of form is discovered . In his recognition of his impersonal self the dancer moves , and this self , in the `` first revealed stroke of its existence '' , states the theme from which all else must follow . The theme may be the formation of a shape from which other shapes evolve . It may be a reaction to a percussive sound , the following movements constituting further reactions . It may establish the relation of the figure of the dancer to light and color , in which case changes in the light or color will set off a kaleidescope of visual designs . Unconcerned with the practical function of his actions , the dancer is engrossed exclusively in their `` motional content '' . Movements unfold freely because they are uninhibited by emotional bias or purposive drive . But the metamorphosis must come first . Though he is also concerned with freeing dance from pedestrian modes of activity , Merce Cunningham has selected a very different method for achieving his aim . He rejects all subjectively motivated continuity , any line of action related to the concept of cause and effect . He bases his approach on the belief that anything can follow anything . An order can be chanced rather than chosen , and this approach produces an experience that is `` free and discovered rather than bound and remembered '' . Thus , there is freshness not only in the individual movements of the dance but in the shape of their continuity as well . Chance , he finds , enables him to create `` a world beyond imagination '' . He cites with pleasure the comment of a lady , who exclaimed after a concert : `` Why , it's extremely interesting . But I would never have thought of it myself '' . The sequence of movements in a Cunningham dance is unlike any sequence to be seen in life . At one side of the stage a dancer jumps excitedly ; ; nearby , another sits motionless , while still another is twirling an umbrella . A man and a girl happen to meet ; ; they look straight at the audience , not at each other . He lifts her , puts her down , and walks off , neither pleased nor disturbed , as if nothing had happened . If one dancer slaps another , the victim may do a pirouette , sit down , or offer his assailant a fork and spoon . Events occur without apparent reason . Their consequences are irrelevant -- or there are no consequences at all . The sequence is determined by chance , and Mr. Cunningham makes use of any one of several chance devices . He may toss coins ; ; he may take slips of paper from a grab bag . The answers derived by these means may determine not only the temporal organization of the dance but also its spatial design , special slips designating the location on the stage where the movement is to be performed . The other variables include the dancer who is to perform the movement and the length of time he is to take in its performance . The only factors that are personally set by the choreographer are the movements themselves , the number of the dancers , and the approximate total duration of the dance . The `` approximate '' is important , because even after the order of the work has been established by the chance method , the result is not inviolable . Each performance may be different . If a work is divided into several large segments , a last-minute drawing of random numbers may determine the order of the segments for any particular performance . And any sequence can not only change its positions in the work but can even be eliminated from it altogether . Mr. Cunningham tries not to cheat the chance method ; ; he adheres to its dictates as faithfully as he can . However , there is always the possibility that chance will make demands the dancers find impossible to execute . Then the choreographer must arbitrate . He must rearrange matters so that two performers do not bump into each other . He must construct transitions so that a dancer who is told to lie prone one second and to leap wildly the next will have some physical preparation for the leap . The North and the South were in greater agreement on sovereignty , through all their dispute about it , than were the Founding Fathers . The truth in their conflicting concepts was expounded by statesmen of the calibre of Webster and Calhoun , and defended in the end by leaders of the nobility of Lincoln and Lee . The people everywhere had grown meanwhile in devotion to basic democratic principles , in understanding of and belief in the federal balance , and in love of their Union . Repeated efforts -- beginning with the Missouri Compromise of 1821 -- were made by such master moderates as Clay and Douglas to resolve the difference peacefully by compromise , rather than clear thought and timely action . Even so , confusion in this period gained such strength ( from compromise and other factors ) that it led to the bloodiest war of the Nineteenth century . Nothing can show more than this the immensity of the danger to democratic peoples that lies in even relatively slight deviation from their true concept of sovereignty . The present issue in Atlantica -- whether to transform an alliance of sovereign nations into a federal union of sovereign citizens -- resembles the American one of 1787-89 rather than the one that was resolved by Civil War . And so I would only touch upon it now ( much as I have long wanted to write a book about it ) . I think it is essential , however , to pinpoint here the difference between the two concepts of sovereignty that went to war in 1861 -- if only to see better how imperative is our need today to clarify completely our far worse confusion on this subject . The difference came down to this : The Southern States insisted that the United States was , in last analysis , what its name implied -- a Union of States . To their leaders the Constitution was a compact made by the people of sovereign states , who therefore retained the right to secede from it . This right of the State , its upholders contended , was essential to maintain the federal balance and protect the liberty of the people from the danger of centralizing power in the Union government . The champions of the Union maintained that the Constitution had formed , fundamentally , the united people of America , that it was a compact among sovereign citizens rather than states , and that therefore the states had no right to secede , though the citizens could . Writing to Speed on August 24 , 1855 , Lincoln made the latter point clear . In homely terms whose timeliness is startling today , he thus declared his own right to secede . `` We began by declaring that all men are created equal . We now practically read it , all men are created equal except Negroes . When the Know-nothings get control , it will read , All men are created equal except Negroes and foreigners and Catholics . When it comes to this , I shall prefer emigrating to some country where they make no pretence of loving liberty -- to Russia , for instance , where despotism can be taken pure , without the base alloy of hypocrisy '' ( His emphasis ) . When the Southern States exercised their `` right to secede '' , they formed what they officially styled `` The Confederate States of America '' . Dictionaries , as we have seen , still cite this government , along with the Articles of Confederation of 1781 , as an example of a confederacy . The fact is that the Southern Confederacy differed from the earlier one almost as much as the Federal Constitution did . The Confederate Constitution copied much of the Federal Constitution verbatim , and most of the rest in substance . It operated on , by and for the people individually just as did the Federal Constitution . It made substantially the same division of power between the central and state governments , and among the executive , legislative and judicial branches . The difference between confederacy and federal union in 1861 Many believe -- and understandably -- that the great difference between the Constitution of the Southern Confederacy and the Federal Constitution was that the former recognized the right of each state to secede . But though each of its members had asserted this right against the Union , the final Constitution which the Confederacy signed on March 11 -- nearly a month before hostilities began -- included no explicit provision authorizing a state to secede . Its drafters discussed this vital point but left it out of their Constitution . Their President , Jefferson Davis , interpreted their Constitution to mean that it `` admits of no coerced association '' , but this remained so doubtful that `` there were frequent demands that the right to secede be put into the Constitution '' . The Constitution of the Southern `` Confederation '' differed from that of the Federal Union only in two important respects : It openly , defiantly , recognized slavery -- an institution which the Southerners of 1787 , even though they continued it , found so impossible to reconcile with freedom that they carefully avoided mentioning the word in the Federal Constitution . They recognized that slavery was a moral issue and not merely an economic interest , and that to recognize it explicitly in their Constitution would be in explosive contradiction to the concept of sovereignty they had set forth in the Declaration of 1776 that `` all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights , that among them are life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness . '' The other important difference between the two Constitutions was that the President of the Confederacy held office for six ( instead of four ) years , and was limited to one term . These are not , however , differences in federal structure . The only important differences from that standpoint , between the two Constitutions , lies in their Preambles . The one of 1861 made clear that in making their government the people were acting through their states , whereas the Preamble of 1787-89 expressed , as clearly as language can , the opposite concept , that they were acting directly as citizens . Here are the two Preambles : Federal Constitution , 1789 `` we the People of the United States , in order to form a more perfect Union , establish Justice , insure domestic Tranquility , provide for the common Defence , promote the general Welfare , and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity , do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America '' . Confederate Constitution , 1861 `` We the people of the Confederate States , each state acting in its sovereign and independent character , in order to form a permanent federal government , establish justice , insure domestic tranquility , and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity -- invoking the favor and the guidance of Almighty God -- do ordain and establish this Constitution for the Confederate States of America '' . One is tempted to say that , on the difference between the concepts of sovereignty in these two preambles , the worst war of the Nineteenth century was fought . But though the Southern States , when drafting a constitution to unite themselves , narrowed the difference to this fine point by omitting to assert the right to secede , the fact remained that by seceding from the Union they had already acted on the concept that it was composed primarily of sovereign states . If the Union conceded this to them , the same right must be conceded to each remaining state whenever it saw fit to secede : This would destroy the federal balance between it and the states , and in the end sacrifice to the sovereignty of the states all the liberty the citizens had gained by their Union . Lincoln saw that the act of secession made the issue for the Union a vital one : Whether it was a Union of sovereign citizens that should continue to live , or an association of sovereign states that must fall prey either to `` anarchy or despotism '' . Much as he abhorred slavery , Lincoln was always willing to concede to each `` slave state '' the right to decide independently whether to continue or end it . Though his election was interpreted by many Southerners as the forerunner of a dangerous shift in the federal balance in favor of the Union , Lincoln himself proposed no such change in the rights the Constitution gave the states . After the war began , he long refused to permit emancipation of the slaves by Union action even in the Border States that stayed with the Union . He issued his Emancipation Proclamation only when he felt that necessity left him no other way to save the Union . In his Message of December 2 , 1862 , he put his purpose and his policy in these words -- which I would call the Lincoln Law of Liberty-and-Union : `` In giving freedom to the slave , we assure freedom to the free '' . What Lincoln could not concede was that the states rather than the people were sovereign in the Union . He fought to the end to preserve it as a `` government of the people , by the people , for the people '' . The truth on each side won in the civil war The fact that the Americans who upheld the sovereignty of their states did this in order to keep many of their people more securely in slavery -- the antithesis of individual liberty -- made the conflict grimmer , and the greater . Out of this ordeal the citizen emerged , in the South as in the North , as America's true sovereign , in `` a new birth of freedom '' , as Lincoln promised . But before this came about , 214,938 Americans had given their lives in battle for the two concepts of the sovereign rights of men and of states . On their decisive battlefield Lincoln did not distinguish between them when he paid tribute to the `` brave men , living and dead , who fought here '' . He understood that both sides were at fault , and he reached the height of saying so explicitly in his Second Inaugural . To my knowledge , Lincoln remains the only Head of State and Commander-in-Chief who , while fighting a fearful war whose issue was in doubt , proved man enough to say this publicly -- to give his foe the benefit of the fact that in all human truth there is some error , and in all our error , some truth . So great a man could not but understand , too , that the thing that moves men to sacrifice their lives is not the error of their thought , which their opponents see and attack , but the truth which the latter do not see -- any more than they see the error which mars the truth they themselves defend . It is much less difficult now than in Lincoln's day to see that on both sides sovereign Americans had given their lives in the Civil War to maintain the balance between the powers they had delegated to the States and to their Union . They differed in the balance they believed essential to the sovereignty of the citizen -- but the supreme sacrifice each made served to maintain a still more fundamental truth : That individual life , liberty and happiness depend on a right balance between the two -- and on the limitation of sovereignty , in all its aspects , which this involves . The 140,414 Americans who gave `` the last full measure of devotion '' to prevent disunion , preserved individual freedom in the United States from the dangers of anarchy , inherent in confederations , which throughout history have proved fatal in the end to all associations composed primarily of sovereign states , and to the liberties of their people . But the fact that 70,524 other Americans gave the same measure of devotion to an opposing concept served Liberty-and-Union in other essential ways . Its appeal from ballots to bullets at Fort Sumter ended by costing the Southerners their right to have slaves -- a right that was even less compatible with the sovereignty of man . The very fact that they came so near to winning by the wrong method , war , led directly to their losing both the war and the wrong thing they fought for , since it forced Lincoln to free their slaves as a military measure . There was a divine justice in one wrong thus undoing another . There was also a lesson , one that has served ever since to keep Americans , in their conflicts with one another , from turning from the ballot to the bullet . Yet though the Southern States lost the worst errors in their case , they did not lose the truth they fought for . The lives so many of them gave , to forestall what they believed would be a fatal encroachment by the Union on the powers reserved to their states have continued ever since to safeguard all Americans against freedom's other foe . As cells coalesced into organisms , they built new `` unnatural '' and internally controlled environments to cope even more successfully with the entropy-increasing properties of the external world . The useful suggestion of Professor David Hawkins which considers culture as a third stage in biological evolution fits quite beautifully then with our suggestion that science has provided us with a rather successful technique for building protective artificial environments . One wonders about its applicability to people . Will advances in human sciences help us build social structures and governments which will enable us to cope with people as effectively as the primitive combination of protein and nucleic acid built a structure of molecules which enabled it to adapt to a sea of molecular interaction ? The answer is , of course , yes . For the family is the simplest example of just such a unit , composed of people , which gives us both some immunity from , and a way of dealing with , other people . Social invention did not have to await social theory any more than use of the warmth of a fire had to await Lavoisier or the buoyant protection of a boat the formulations of Archimedes . But it has been during the last two centuries , during the scientific revolution , that our independence from the physical environment has made the most rapid strides . We have ample light when the sun sets ; ; the temperature of our homes is independent of the seasons ; ; we fly through the air , although gravity pulls us down ; ; the range of our voice ignores distance . At what stage are social sciences then ? Is the future of psychology akin to the rich future of physics at the time of Newton ? There is a haunting resemblance between the notion of cause in Copernicus and in Freud . And it is certainly no slight to either of them to compare both their achievements and their impact . Political theoretical understanding , although almost at a standstill during this century , did develop during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , and resulted in a flood of inventions which increased the possibility for man to coexist with man . Consitutional government , popular vote , trial by jury , public education , labor unions , cooperatives , communes , socialized ownership , world courts , and the veto power in world councils are but a few examples . Most of these , with horrible exceptions , were conceived as is a ship , not as an attempt to quell the ocean of mankind , nor to deny its force , but as a means to survive and enjoy it . The most effective political inventions seem to make maximum use of natural harbors and are aware that restraining breakwaters can play only a minor part in the whole scheme . Just as present technology had to await the explanations of physics , so one might expect that social invention will follow growing sociological understanding . We are desperately in the need of such invention , for man is still very much at the mercy of man . In fact the accumulation of the hardware of destruction is day by day increasing our fear of each other . 3 , I want , therefore , to discuss a second and quite different fruit of science , the connection between scientific understanding and fear . There are certainly large areas of understanding in the human sciences which in themselves and even without political invention can help to dispel our present fears . Lucretius has remarked : `` The reason why all Mortals are so gripped by fear is that they see all sorts of things happening in the earth and sky with no discernable cause , and these they attribute to the will of God '' . Perhaps things were even worse then . It is difficult to reconstruct the primeval fears of man . We get some clue from a few remembrances of childhood and from the circumstance that we are probably not much more afraid of people now than man ever was . We are not now afraid of atomic bombs in the same way that people once feared comets . The bombs are as harmless as an automobile in a garage . We are worried about what people may do with them -- that some crazy fool may `` push the button '' . I am certainly not adequately trained to describe or enlarge on human fears , but there are certain features of the fears dispelled by scientific explanations that stand out quite clearly . They are in general those fears that once seemed to have been amenable to prayer or ritual . They include both individual fears and collective ones . They arise in situations in which one believes that what happens depends not only on the external world , but also on the precise pattern of behavior of the individual or group . Often it is recognized that all the details of the pattern may not be essential to the outcome but , because the pattern was empirically determined and not developed through theoretical understanding , one is never quite certain which behavior elements are effective , and the whole pattern becomes ritualized . Yet often fear persists because , even with the most rigid ritual , one is never quite free from the uneasy feeling that one might make some mistake or that in every previous execution one had been unaware of the really decisive act . To say that science had reduced many such fears merely reiterates the obvious and frequent statement that science eliminated much of magic and superstition . But a somewhat more detailed analysis of this process may be illuminating . The frequently postulated antique worry that the daylight hours might dwindle to complete darkness apparently gave rise to a ritual and celebration which we still recognize . It is curious that even centuries of repetition of the yearly cycle did not induce a sufficient degree of confidence to allow people to abandon the ceremonies of the winter solstice . This and other fears of the solar system have disappeared gradually , first , with the Ptolemaic system and its built-in concept of periodicity and then , more firmly , with the Newtonian innovation of an universal force that could account quantitatively for both terrestial and celestial motions . This understanding provides a very simple example of the fact that one can eliminate fear without instituting any controls . In fact , although we have dispelled the fear , we have not necessarily assured ourselves that there are no dangers . There is still the remote possibility of planetoid collision . A meteor could fall on San Francisco . Solar activities could presumably bring long periods of flood or drought . Our understanding of the solar system has taught us to replace our former elaborate rituals with the appropriate action which , in this case , amounts to doing nothing . Yet we no longer feel uneasy . This almost trivial example is nevertheless suggestive , for there are some elements in common between the antique fear that the days would get shorter and shorter and our present fear of war . We , in our country , think of war as an external threat which , if it occurs , will not be primarily of our own doing . And yet we obviously also believe that the avoidance of the disaster depends in some obscure or at least uncertain way on the details of how we behave . What elements of our behavior are decisive ? Our weapons production , our world prestige , our ideas of democracy , our actions of trust or stubbornness or secrecy or espionage ? We have staved off a war and , since our behavior has involved all these elements , we can only keep adding to our ritual without daring to abandon any part of it , since we have not the slightest notion which parts are effective . I think that we are here also talking of the kind of fear that a young boy has for a group of boys who are approaching at night along the streets of a large city . If an automobile were approaching him , he would know what was required of him , even though he might not be able to act quickly enough . With the group of boys it is different . He does not know whether to look up or look aside , to put his hands in his pockets or to clench them at his side , to cross the street , or to continue on the same side . When confronted with a drunk or an insane person I have no notion of what any one of them might do to me or to himself or to others . I believe that what I do has some effect on his actions and I have learned , in a way , to commune with drunks , but certainly my actions seem to resemble more nearly the performance of a rain dance than the carrying out of an experiment in physics . I am usually filled with an uneasiness that through some unwitting slip all hell may break loose . Our inability to explain why certain people are fond of us frequently induces the same kind of ritual and malaise . We are forced , in our behavior towards others , to adopt empirically successful patterns in toto because we have such a minimal understanding of their essential elements . Our collective policies , group and national , are similarly based on voodoo , but here we often lack even the empirically successful rituals and are still engaged in determing them . We use terms from our personal experience with individuals such as `` trust '' , `` cheat '' , and `` get tough '' . We talk about national character in the same way that Copernicus talked of the compulsions of celestial bodies to move in circles . We perform elaborate international exhortations and ceremonies with virtually no understanding of social cause and effect . Small wonder , then , that we fear . The achievements which dispelled our fears of the cosmos took place three centuries ago . What additional roles has the scientific understanding of the 19th and 20th centuries played ? In the physical sciences , these achievements concern electricity , chemistry , and atomic physics . In the life sciences , there has been an enormous increase in our understanding of disease , in the mechanisms of heredity , and in bio- and physiological chemistry . The major effect of these advances appears to lie in the part they have played in the industrial revolution and in the tools which scientific understanding has given us to build and manipulate a more protective environment . In addition , our way of dealing directly with natural phenomena has also changed . Even in domains where detailed and predictive understanding is still lacking , but where some explanations are possible , as with lightning and weather and earthquakes , the appropriate kind of human action has been more adequately indicated . Apparently the population as a whole eventually acquires enough confidence in the explanations of the scientists to modify its procedures and its fears . How and why this process occurs would provide an interesting separate subject for study . In some areas , the progress is slower than in others . In agriculture , for example , despite the advances in biology , elaborate rituals tend to persist along with a continued sense of the imminence of some natural disaster . In child care , the opposite extreme prevails ; ; procedures change rapidly and parental confidence probably exceeds anything warranted by established psychological theory . There are many domains in which understanding has brought about widespread and quite appropriate reduction in ritual and fear . Much of the former extreme uneasiness associated with visions and hallucinations and with death has disappeared . The persistent horror of having a malformed child has , I believe , been reduced , not because we have gained any control over this misfortune , but precisely because we have learned that we have so little control over it . In fact , the recent warnings about the use of X-rays have introduced fears and ambiguities of action which now require more detailed understanding , and thus in this instance , science has momentarily aggravated our fears . In fact , insofar as science generates any fear , it stems not so much from scientific prowess and gadgets but from the fact that new unanswered questions arise , which , until they are understood , create uncertainty . Perhaps the most illuminating example of the reduction of fear through understanding is derived from our increased knowledge of the nature of disease . The situation with regard to our attitude and `` control '' of disease contains close analogies to problems confronting us with respect to people . The fear of disease was formerly very much the kind of fear I have tried to describe . Nothing like Godot , he arrived before the hour . His letter had suggested we meet at my hotel at noon on Sunday , and I came into the lobby as the clock struck twelve . He was waiting . My wish to meet Samuel Beckett had been prompted by simple curiosity and interest in his work . American newspaper reviewers like to call his plays nihilistic . They find deep pessimism in them . Even so astute a commentator as Harold Clurman of The Nation has said that `` Waiting For Godot '' is `` the concentrate of the contemporary European mood of despair '' . But to me Beckett's writing had seemed permeated with love for human beings and with a kind of humor that I could reconcile neither with despair nor with nihilism . Could it be that my own eyes and ears had deceived me ? Is his a literature of defeat , irrelevant to the social crises we face ? Or is it relevant because it teaches us something useful to know about ourselves ? I knew that a conversation with the author would not settle such questions , because a man is not the same as his writing : in the last analysis , the questions had to be settled by the work itself . Nevertheless I was curious . My curiosity was sharpened a day or two before the interview by a conversation I had with a well-informed teacher of literature , a Jesuit father , at a conference on religious drama near Paris . When Beckett's name came into the discussion , the priest grew loud and told me that Beckett `` hates life '' . That , I thought , is at least one thing I can find out when we meet . Beckett's appearance is rough-hewn Irish . The features of his face are distinct , but not fine . They look as if they had been sculptured with an unsharpened chisel . Unruly hair goes straight up from his forehead , standing so high that the top falls gently over , as if to show that it really is hair and not bristle . One might say it combines the man ; ; own pride and humility . For he has the pride that comes of self-acceptance and the humility , perhaps of the same genesis , not to impose himself upon another . His light blue eyes , set deep within the face , are actively and continually looking . He seems , by some unconscious division of labor , to have given them that one function and no other , leaving communication to the rest of the face . The mouth frequently breaks into a disarming smile . The voice is light in timbre , with a rough edge that corresponds to his visage . The Irish accent is , as one would expect , combined with slight inflections from the French . His tweed suit was a baggy gray and green . He wore a brown knit sports shirt with no tie . We walked down the Rue De L'Arcade , thence along beside the Madeleine and across to a sidewalk cafe opposite that church . The conversation that ensued may have been engrossing but it could hardly be called world-shattering . For one thing , the world that Beckett sees is already shattered . His talk turns to what he calls `` the mess '' , or sometimes `` this buzzing confusion '' . I reconstruct his sentences from notes made immediately after our conversation . What appears here is shorter than what he actually said but very close to his own words . `` The confusion is not my invention . We cannot listen to a conversation for five minutes without being acutely aware of the confusion . It is all around us and our only chance now is to let it in . The only chance of renovation is to open our eyes and see the mess . It is not a mess you can make sense of '' . I suggested that one must let it in because it is the truth , but Beckett did not take to the word truth . `` What is more true than anything else ? To swim is true , and to sink is true . One is not more true than the other . One cannot speak anymore of being , one must speak only of the mess . When Heidegger and Sartre speak of a contrast between being and existence , they may be right , I don't know , but their language is too philosophical for me . I am not a philosopher . One can only speak of what is in front of him , and that now is simply the mess '' . Then he began to speak about the tension in art between the mess and form . Until recently , art has withstood the pressure of chaotic things . It has held them at bay . It realized that to admit them was to jeopardize form . `` How could the mess be admitted , because it appears to be the very opposite of form and therefore destructive of the very thing that art holds itself to be '' ? But now we can keep it out no longer , because we have come into a time when `` it invades our experience at every moment . It is there and it must be allowed in '' . I granted this might be so , but found the result to be even more attention to form than was the case previously . And why not ? How , I asked , could chaos be admitted to chaos ? Would not that be the end of thinking and the end of art ? If we look at recent art we find it preoccupied with form . Beckett's own work is an example . Plays more highly formalized than `` Waiting For Godot '' , `` Endgame '' , and `` Krapp's Last Tape '' would be hard to find . `` What I am saying does not mean that there will henceforth be no form in art . It only means that there will be new form , and that this form will be of such a type that it admits the chaos and does not try to say that the chaos is really something else . The form and the chaos remain separate . The latter is not reduced to the former . That is why the form itself becomes a preoccupation , because it exists as a problem separate from the material it accommodates . To find a form that accommodates the mess , that is the task of the artist now '' . Yet , I responded , could not similar things be said about the art of the past ? Is it not characteristic of the greatest art that it confronts us with something we cannot clarify , demanding that the viewer respond to it in his own never-predictable way ? What is the history of criticism but the history of men attempting to make sense of the manifold elements in art that will not allow themselves to be reduced to a single philosophy or a single aesthetic theory ? Isn't all art ambiguous ? `` Not this '' , he said , and gestured toward the Madeleine . The classical lines of the church which Napoleon thought of as a Temple of Glory , dominated all the scene where we sat . The Boulevard De La Madeleine , the Boulevard Malesherbes , and the Rue Royale ran to it with graceful flattery , bearing tidings of the Age of Reason . `` Not this . This is clear . This does not allow the mystery to invade us . With classical art , all is settled . But it is different at Chartres . There is the unexplainable , and there art raises questions that it does not attempt to answer '' . I asked about the battle between life and death in his plays . Didi and Gogo hover on the edge of suicide ; ; Hamm's world is death and Clov may or may not get out of it to join the living child outside . Is this life-death question a part of the chaos ? `` Yes . If life and death did not both present themselves to us , there would be no inscrutability . If there were only darkness , all would be clear . It is because there is not only darkness but also light that our situation becomes inexplicable . Take Augustine's doctrine of grace given and grace withheld : have you pondered the dramatic qualities in this theology ? Two thieves are crucified with Christ , one saved and the other damned . How can we make sense of this division ? In classical drama , such problems do not arise . The destiny of Racine's Phedre is sealed from the beginning : she will proceed into the dark . As she goes , she herself will be illuminated . At the beginning of the play she has partial illumination and at the end she has complete illumination , but there has been no question but that she moves toward the dark . That is the play . Within this notion clarity is possible , but for us who are neither Greek nor Jansenist there is not such clarity . The question would also be removed if we believed in the contrary -- total salvation . But where we have both dark and light we have also the inexplicable . The key word in my plays is ' perhaps ' '' . Given a theological lead , I asked what he thinks about those who find a religious significance to his plays . `` Well , really there is none at all . I have no religious feeling . Once I had a religious emotion . It was at my first Communion . No more . My mother was deeply religious . So was my brother . He knelt down at his bed as long as he could kneel . My father had none . The family was Protestant , but for me it was only irksome and I let it go . My brother and mother got no value from their religion when they died . At the moment of crisis it had no more depth than an old school tie . Irish Catholicism is not attractive , but it is deeper . When you pass a church on an Irish bus , all the hands flurry in the sign of the cross . One day the dogs of Ireland will do that too and perhaps also the pigs '' . But do the plays deal with the same facets of experience religion must also deal with ? `` Yes , for they deal with distress . Some people object to this in my writing . At a party an English intellectual -- so-called -- asked me why I write always about distress . As if it were perverse to do so ! He wanted to know if my father had beaten me or my mother had run away from home to give me an unhappy childhood . I told him no , that I had had a very happy childhood . Then he thought me more perverse than ever . I left the party as soon as possible and got into a taxi . On the glass partition between me and the driver were three signs : one asked for help for the blind , another help for orphans , and the third for relief for the war refugees . One does not have to look for distress . It is screaming at you even in the taxis of London '' . Lunch was over , and we walked back to the hotel with the light and dark of Paris screaming at us . The personal quality of Samuel Beckett is similar to qualities I had found in the plays . He says nothing that compresses experience within a closed pattern . `` Perhaps '' stands in place of commitment . At the same time , he is plainly sympathetic , clearly friendly . If there were only the mess , all would be clear ; ; but there is also compassion . As a Christian , I know I do not stand where Beckett stands , but I do see much of what he sees . As a writer on the theater , I have paid close attention to the plays . Harold Clurman is right to say that `` Waiting For Godot '' is a reflection ( he calls it a distorted reflection ) `` of the impasse and disarray of Europe's present politics , ethic , and common way of life '' . Yet it is not only Europe the play refers to . `` Waiting For Godot '' sells even better in America than in France . The consciousness it mirrors may have come earlier to Europe than to America , but it is the consciousness that most `` mature '' societies arrive at when their successes in technological and economic systematization propel them into a time of examining the not-strictly-practical ends of culture . America is now joining Europe in this `` mature '' phase of development . Whether any of us remain in it long will depend on what happens as a result of the technological and economic revolutions now going on in the countries of Asia and Africa , and also of course on how long the cold war remains cold . Even Hemingway , for all his efforts to formulate a naturalistic morality in The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell To Arms never maintained that sex was all . Hemingway's fiction is supported by a `` moral '' backbone and in its search for ultimate meaning hints at a religious dimension . And D. H. Lawrence , in Fantasia Of The Unconscious , protested vehemently against the overestimation of the sexual motive . Though sex in some form or other enters into all human activity and it was a good thing that Freud emphasized this aspect of human nature , it is fantastic to explain everything in terms of sex . `` All is not sex '' , declared Lawrence . Man is not confined to one outlet for his vital energy . The creative urge , for example , transcends the body and the self . But for the beat generation all is sex . Nothing is more revealing of the way of life and literary aspirations of this group than their attitude toward sex . For the beatnik , like the hipster , is in opposition to a society that is based on the repression of the sex instinct . He has elevated sex -- not Eros or libido but pure , spontaneous , uninhibited sex -- to the rank of the godhead ; ; it is Astarte , Ishtar , Venus , Yahwe , Dionysus , Christ , the mysterious and divine orgone energy flowing through the body of the universe . Jazz is sex , marijuana is a stimulus to sex , the beat tempo is adjusted to the orgiastic release of the sexual impulse . Lawrence Lipton , in The Holy Barbarians , stresses that for the beat generation sex is more than a source of pleasure ; ; it is a mystique , and their private language is rich in the multivalent ambiguities of sexual reference so that they dwell in a sexualized universe of discourse . The singular uncompromising force of their revolt against the cult of restraint is illustrated by their refusal to dance in a public place . The dance is but a disguised ritual for the expression of ungratified sexual desire . For this reason , too , their language is more forthright and earthy . The beatniks crave a sexual experience in which their whole being participates . It is therefore not surprising that they resist the lure of marriage and the trap of domesticity , for like cats they are determined not to tame their sexual energy . They withdraw to the underground of the slums where they can defy the precepts of legalized propriety . Unlike the heroes and flappers of the lost generation , they disdain the art of `` necking '' and `` petting '' . That is reserved for the squares . If they avoid the use of the pungent , outlawed four-letter word it is because it is taboo ; ; it is sacred . As Lipton , the prophet of the beat generation , declares : `` In the sexual act , the beat are filled with mana , the divine power . This is far from the vulgar , leering sexuality of the middle-class square in heat '' . This is the Holy Grail these knights of the orgasm pursue , this is the irresistible cosmic urge to which they respond . If Wilhelm Reich is the Moses who has led them out of the Egypt of sexual slavery , Dylan Thomas is the poet who offers them the Dionysian dialectic of justification for their indulgence in liquor , marijuana , sex , and jazz . In addition , they have been converted to Zen Buddhism , with its glorification of all that is `` natural '' and mysteriously alive , the sense that everything in the world is flowing . Thus , paradoxically , the beat writers resort to `` religious '' metaphors : they are in search of mana , the spiritual , the numinous , but not anything connected with formal religion . What they are after is the beatific vision . And Zen Buddhism , though it is extremely difficult to understand how these internal contradictions are reconciled , helps them in their struggle to achieve personal salvation through sexual release . The style of life chosen by the beat generation , the rhythm and ritual they have adopted as uniquely their own , is designed to enhance the value of the sexual experience . Jazz is good not only because it promotes wholeness but because of its decided sexual effect . Jazz is the musical language of sex , the vocabulary of the orgasm ; ; indeed , it is maintained that the sexual element in jazz , by freeing the listener of his inhibitions , can have therapeutic value . That is why , the argument runs , the squares are so fearful of jazz and yet perversely fascinated by it . Instead of giving themselves spontaneously to the orgiastic release that jazz can give them , they undergo psychoanalysis or flirt with mysticism or turn to prostitutes for satisfaction . Thus jazz is transmuted into something holy , the sacred road to integration of being . Jazz , like sex , is a mystique . It is not a substitute for sex but a dynamic expression of the creative impulse in unfettered man . The mystique of sex , combined with marijuana and jazz , is intended to provide a design for living . Those who are sexually liberated can become creatively alive and free , their instincts put at the service of the imagination . Righteous in their denunciation of all that makes for death , the beat prophets bid all men become cool cats ; ; let them learn to `` swing '' freely , to let go , to become authentically themselves , and then perhaps civilization will be saved . The beatnik , seceding from a society that is fatally afflicted with a deathward drive , is concerned with his personal salvation in the living present . If he is the child of nothingness , if he is the predestined victim of an age of atomic wars , then he will consult only his own organic needs and go beyond good and evil . He will not curb his instinctual desires but release the energy within him that makes him feel truly and fully alive , even if it is only for this brief moment before the apocalypse of annihilation explodes on earth . That is why the members of the beat generation proudly assume the title of the holy barbarians ; ; they will destroy the shrines , temples , museums , and churches of the state that is the implacable enemy of the life they believe in . Apart from the categorical imperative they derive from the metaphysics of the orgasm , the only affirmation they are capable of making is that art is their only refuge . Their writing , born of their experiments in marijuana and untrammeled sexuality , reflects the extremity of their existential alienation . The mind has betrayed them , reason is the foe of life ; ; they will trust only their physical sensations , the wisdom of the body , the holy promptings of the unconscious . With lyrical intensity they reveal what they hate , but their faith in love , inspired by the revolutionary rhythms of jazz , culminates in the climax of the orgasm . Their work mirrors the mentality of the psychopath , rootless and irresponsible . Their rebellion against authoritarian society is not far removed from the violence of revolt characteristic of the juvenile delinquent . And the life they lead is undisciplined and for the most part unproductive , even though they make a fetish of devoting themselves to some creative pursuit -- writing , painting , music . They are non-conformists on principle . When they express themselves it is incandescent hatred that shines forth , the rage of repudiation , the ecstasy of negation . It is sex that obsesses them , sex that is at the basis of their aesthetic creed . What they discuss with dialectical seriousness is the degree to which sex can inspire the Muse . Monogamy is the vice from which the abjectly fearful middle class continue to suffer , whereas the beatnik has the courage to break out of that prison of respectability . One girl describes her past , her succession of broken marriages , the abortions she has had and finally confesses that she loves sex and sees no reason why she must justify her passion . If it is an honest feeling , then why should she not yield to it ? `` Most often '' , she says , `` it's the monogamous relationship that is dishonest '' . There is nothing holy in wedlock . This girl soon drops the bourgeois pyschiatrist who disapproves of her life . She finds married life stifling and every prolonged sex relationship unbearably monotonous . This confession serves to make clear in part what is behind this sexual revolution : the craving for sensation for its own sake , the need for change , for new experiences . Boredom is death . In the realm of physical sensations , sex reigns supreme . Hence the beatniks sustain themselves on marijuana , jazz , free swinging poetry , exhausting themselves in orgies of sex ; ; some of them are driven over the borderline of sanity and lose contact with reality . One beat poet composes a poem , `` Lines On A Tijuana John '' , which contains a few happy hints for survival . The new fact the initiates of this cult have to learn is that they must move toward simplicity . The professed mission of this disaffiliated generation is to find a new way of life which they can express in poetry and fiction , but what they produce is unfortunately disordered , nourished solely on the hysteria of negation . Who are the creative representatives of this movement ? Nymphomaniacs , junkies , homosexuals , drug addicts , lesbians , alcoholics , the weak , the frustrated , the irresolute , the despairing , the derelicts and outcasts of society . They embrace independent poverty , usually with a `` shack-up '' partner who will help support them . They are full of contempt for the institution of matrimony . Their previous legalized marriages do not count , for they hold the laws of the state null and void . They feel they are leagued against a hostile , persecutory world , faced with the concerted malevolent opposition of squares and their hirelings , the police . This is the rhetoric of righteousness the beatniks use in defending their way of life , their search for wholeness , though their actual existence fails to reach these `` religious '' heights . One beatnik got the woman he was living with so involved in drugs and self-analysis and all-night sessions of sex that she was beginning to crack up . What obsessions had she picked up during these long nights of talk ? Sex as the creative principle of the universe , the secret of primitive religion , the life of myth . Everything in the final analysis reduced itself to sexual symbolism . In his chapter on `` The Loveways Of The Beat Generation '' , Lipton spares the reader none of the sordid details . No one asks questions about the free union of the sexes in West Venice so long as the partners share the negative attitudes of the group . The women who come to West Venice , having forsaken radicalism , are interested in living only for the moment , in being constantly on the move . Others who are attracted to this Mecca of the beat generation are homosexuals , heroin addicts , and smalltime hoodlums . Those who are sexual deviants are naturally drawn to join the beatniks . Since the homosexuals widely use marijuana , they do not have to be initiated . Part of the ritual of sex is the use of marijuana . As Lipton puts it : `` The Eros is felt in the magic circle of marijuana with far greater force , as a unifying principle in human relationships , than at any other time except , perhaps , in the mutual metaphysical orgasms . The magic circle is , in fact , a symbol of and preparation for the metaphysical orgasm '' . Under the influence of marijuana the beatnik comes alive within and experiences a wonderfully enhanced sense of self as if he had discovered the open sesame to the universe of being . Carried high on this `` charge '' , he composes `` magical '' poetry that captures the organic rhythms of life in words . If he thus achieves a lyrical , dreamlike , drugged intensity , he pays the price for his indulgence by producing work -- Allen Ginsberg's `` Howl '' is a striking example of this tendency -- that is disoriented , Dionysian but without depth and without Apollonian control . For drugs are in themselves no royal road to creativity . How is the beat poet to achieve unity of form when he is at the same time engaged in a systematic derangement of senses . If love reflects the nature of man , as Ortega Y Gasset believes , if the person in love betrays decisively what he is by his behavior in love , then the writers of the beat generation are creating a new literary genre . There were fences in the old days when we were children . Across the front of a yard and down the side , they were iron , either spiked along the top or arched in half circles . Alley fences were made of solid boards higher than one's head , but not so high as the golden glow in a corner or the hollyhocks that grew in a line against them . Side fences were hidden beneath lilacs and hundred-leaf roses ; ; front fences were covered with Virginia creeper or trumpet vines or honeysuckle . Square corner- and gate posts were an open-work pattern of cast-iron foliage ; ; they were topped by steeples complete in every detail : high-pitched roof , pinnacle , and narrow gable . On these posts the gates swung open with a squeak and shut with a metallic clang . The only extended view possible to anyone less tall than the fences was that obtained from an upper bough of the apple tree . The primary quality of that view seems , now , to have been its quietness , but that cannot at the time have impressed us . What one actually remembers is its greenness . From high in the tree , the whole block lay within range of the eye , but the ground was almost nowhere visible . One looked down on a sea of leaves , a breaking wave of flower . Every path from back door to barn was covered by a grape-arbor , and every yard had its fruit trees . In the center of any open space remaining our grandfathers had planted syringa and sweet-shrub , snowball , rose-of-Sharon and balm-of-Gilead . From above one could only occasionally catch a glimpse of life on the floor of this green sea : a neighbor's gingham skirt flashing into sight for an instant on the path beneath her grape-arbor , or the movement of hands above a clothesline and the flutter of garments hung there , half-way down the block . That was one epoch : the apple-tree epoch . Another had ended before it began . Time is a queer thing and memory a queerer ; ; the tricks that time plays with memory and memory with time are queerest of all . From maturity one looks back at the succession of years , counts them and makes them many , yet cannot feel length in the number , however large . In a stream that turns a mill-wheel there is a lot of water ; ; the mill-pond is quiet , its surface dark and shadowed , and there does not seem to be much water in it . Time in the sum is nothing . And yet -- a year to a child is an eternity , and in the memory that phase of one's being -- a certain mental landscape -- will seem to have endured without beginning and without end . The part of the mind that preserves dates and events may remonstrate , `` It could have been like that for only a little while '' ; ; but true memory does not count nor add : it holds fast to things that were and they are outside of time . Once , then -- for how many years or how few does not matter -- my world was bound round by fences , when I was too small to reach the apple tree bough , to twist my knee over it and pull myself up . That world was in scale with my own smallness . I have no picture in my mind of the garden as a whole -- that I could not see -- but certain aspects of certain corners linger in the memory : wind-blown , frost-bitten , white chrysanthemums beneath a window , with their brittle brown leaves and their sharp scent of November ; ; ripe pears lying in long grass , to be turned over by a dusty-slippered foot , cautiously , lest bees still worked in the ragged , brown-edged holes ; ; hot-colored verbenas in the corner between the dining-room wall and the side porch , where we passed on our way to the pump with the half-gourd tied to it as a cup by my grandmother for our childish pleasure in drinking from it . It was mother who planted the verbenas . I think that my grandmother was not an impassioned gardener : she was too indulgent a lover of dogs and grandchildren . My great-grandmother , I have been told , made her garden her great pride ; ; she cherished rare and delicate plants like oleanders in tubs and wall-flowers and lemon verbenas in pots that had to be wintered in the cellar ; ; she filled the waste spots of the yard with common things like the garden heliotrope in a corner by the woodshed , and the plantain lilies along the west side of the house . These my grandmother left in their places ( they are still there , more persistent and longer-lived than the generations of man ) and planted others like them , that flourished without careful tending . Three of these only were protected from us by stern commandment : the roses , whose petals might not be collected until they had fallen , to be made into perfume or rose-tea to drink ; ; the peonies , whose tight sticky buds would be blighted by the laying on of a finger , although they were not apparently harmed by the ants that crawled over them ; ; and the poppies . I have more than once sat cross-legged in the grass through a long summer morning and watched without touching while a poppy bud higher than my head slowly but visibly pushed off its cap , unfolded , and shook out like a banner in the sun its flaming vermilion petals . Other flowers we might gather as we pleased : myrtle and white violets from beneath the lilacs ; ; the lilacs themselves , that bloomed so prodigally but for the most part beyond our reach ; ; snowballs ; ; hollyhock blossoms that , turned upside down , make pink-petticoated ladies ; ; and the little , dark blue larkspur that scattered its seed everywhere . More potent a charm to bring back that time of life than this record of a few pictures and a few remembered facts would be a catalogue of the minutiae which are of the very stuff of the mind , intrinsic , because they were known in the beginning not by the eye alone but by the hand that held them . Flowers , stones , and small creatures , living and dead . Pale yellow snapdragons that by pinching could be made to bite ; ; seed-pods of the balsams that snapped like fire-crackers at a touch ; ; red-and-yellow columbines whose round-tipped spurs were picked off and eaten for the honey in them ; ; morning-glory buds which could be so grasped and squeezed that they burst like a blown-up paper bag ; ; bright flowers from the trumpet vine that made `` gloves '' on the ends of ten waggling fingers . Fuzzy caterpillars , snails with their sensitive horns , struggling grasshoppers held by their long hind legs and commanded to `` spit tobacco , spit '' . Dead fledgling birds , their squashed-looking nakedness and the odor of decay that clung to the hand when they had been buried in our graveyard in front of the purple flags . And the cast shell of a locust , straw-colored and transparent , weighing nothing , fragile but entire , with eyes like bubbles and a gaping slit down its back . Every morning early , in the summer , we searched the trunks of the trees as high as we could reach for the locust shells , carefully detached their hooked claws from the bark where they hung , and stabled them , a weird faery herd , in an angle between the high roots of the tulip tree , where no grass grew in the dense shade . We collected `` lucky stones '' -- all the creamy translucent pebbles , worn smooth and round , that we could find in the driveway . When these had been pocketed , we could still spend a morning cracking open other pebbles for our delight in seeing how much prettier they were inside than their dull exteriors indicated . We showed them to each other and said `` Would you have guessed '' ? Squatting on our haunches beside the flat stone we broke them on , we were safe behind the high closed gates at the end of the drive : safe from interruption and the observation and possible amusement of the passers-by . Thus shielded , we played many foolish games in comfortable unselfconsciousness ; ; even when the fences became a part of the game -- when a vine-embowered gate-post was the Sleeping Beauty's enchanted castle , or when Rapunzel let down her golden hair from beneath the crocketed spire , even then we paid little heed to those who went by on the path outside . We enjoyed a paradoxical freedom when we were still too young for school . In the heat of the summer , the garden solitudes were ours alone ; ; our elders stayed in the dark house or sat fanning on the front porch . They never troubled themselves about us while we were playing , because the fence formed such a definite boundary and `` Don't go outside the gate '' was a command so impossible of misinterpretation . We were not , however , entirely unacquainted with the varying aspects of the street . We were forbidden to swing on the gates , lest they sag on their hinges in a poor-white-trash way , but we could stand on them , when they were latched , rest our chins on the top , and stare and stare , committing to memory , quite unintentionally , all the details that lay before our eyes . The street that is full now of traffic and parked cars then and for many years drowsed on an August afternoon in the shade of the curbside trees , and silence was a weight , almost palpable , in the air . Every slight sound that rose against that pressure fell away again , crushed beneath it . A hay-wagon moved slowly along the gutter , the top of it swept by the low boughs of the maple trees , and loose straws were left hanging tangled among the leaves . A wheel squeaked on a hub , was still , and squeaked again . If a child watched its progress he whispered , `` Hay , hay , load of hay -- make a wish and turn away '' , and then stared rigidly in the opposite direction until the sound of the horses' feet returned no more . When the hay wagon had gone , and an interval passed , a huckster's cart might turn the corner . The horse walked , the reins were slack , the huckster rode with bowed shoulders , his forearms across his knees . Sleepily , as if half-reluctant to break the silence , he lifted his voice : `` Rhu-beb-ni-ice nice fresh rhu-beb today '' ! The lazy sing-song was spaced in time like the drone of a bumble-bee . No one seemed to hear him , no one heeded . The horse plodded on , and he repeated his call . It became so monotonous as to seem a part of the quietness . After his passage , the street was empty again . The sun moved slant-wise across the sky and down ; ; the trees' shadows circled from street to sidewalk , from sidewalk to lawn . At four-o'clock , or four-thirty , the coming of the newsboy marked the end of the day ; ; he tossed a paper toward every front door , and housewives came down to their steps to pick them up and read what their neighbors had been doing . The streets of any county town were like this on any sunshiny afternoon in summer ; ; they were like this fifty-odd years ago , and yesterday . But the fences were still in place fifty-odd years ago , and when we stood on the gate to look over , the sidewalk under our eyes was not cement but two rows of paving stones with grass between and on both sides . The curb was a line of stone laid edgewise in the dirt and tilted this way and that by frost in the ground or the roots of trees . Opposite every gate was a hitching post or a stone carriage-step , set with a rusty iron ring for tying a horse . The street was unpaved and rose steeply toward the center ; ; it was mud in wet weather and dust , ankle-deep , in dry , and could be crossed only at the corner where there were stepping stones . It had a bucolic atmosphere that it has lost long since . The hoofmarks of cattle and the prints of bare feet in the mud or in the dust were as numerous as the traces of shod horses . Cows were kept in backyard barns , boys were hired to drive them to and from the pasture on the edge of town , and familiar to the ear , morning and evening , were the boys' coaxing voices , the thud of hooves , and the thwack of a stick on cowhide . It is worth dwelling in some detail on the crisis of this story , because it brings together a number of characteristic elements and makes of them a curious , riddling compound obscurely but centrally significant for Mann's work . The wife , Amra , and her lover are both savagely portrayed , she as incarnate sensuality , `` voluptuous '' and `` indolent '' , possibly `` a mischief maker '' , with `` a kind of luxurious cunning '' to set against her apparent simplicity , her `` birdlike brain '' . Lautner , for his part , `` belonged to the present-day race of small artists , who do not demand the utmost of themselves '' , and the bitter description of the type includes such epithets as `` wretched little poseurs '' , the devastating indictment `` they do not know how to be wretched decently and in order '' , and the somewhat extreme prophecy , so far not fulfilled : `` They will be destroyed '' . The trick these two play upon Jacoby reveals their want not simply of decency but of imagination as well . His appearance as Lizzy evokes not amusement but horror in the audience ; ; it is a spectacle absolutely painful , an epiphany of the suffering flesh unredeemed by spirit , untouched by any spirit other than abasement and humiliation . At the same time the multiple transvestitism involved -- the fat man as girl and as baby , as coquette pretending to be a baby -- touches for a moment horrifyingly upon the secret sources of a life like Jacoby's , upon the sinister dreams which form the sources of any human life . The music which Lautner has composed for this episode is for the most part `` rather pretty and perfectly banal '' . But it is characteristic of him , we are told , `` his little artifice '' , to be able to introduce `` into a fairly vulgar and humorous piece of hackwork a sudden phrase of genuine creative art '' . And this occurs now , at the refrain of Jacoby's song -- at the point , in fact , of the name `` Lizzy '' -- ; ; a modulation described as `` almost a stroke of genius '' . `` A miracle , a revelation , it was like a curtain suddenly torn away to reveal something nude '' . It is this modulation which reveals to Jacoby his own frightful abjection and , simultaneously , his wife's infidelity . By the same means he perceives this fact as having communicated itself to the audience ; ; he collapses , and dies . In the work of every artist , I suppose , there may be found one or more moments which strike the student as absolutely decisive , ultimately emblematic of what it is all about ; ; not less strikingly so for being mysterious , as though some deeply hidden constatation of thoughts were enciphered in a single image , a single moment . So here . The horrifying humor , the specifically sexual embarrassment of the joke gone wrong , the monstrous image of the fat man dressed up as a whore dressing up as a baby ; ; the epiphany of that quivering flesh ; ; the bringing together around it of the secret liaison between indolent , mindless sensuality and sharp , shrewd talent , cleverness with an occasional touch of genius ( which , however , does not know `` how to attack the problem of suffering '' ) ; ; the miraculous way in which music , revelation and death are associated in a single instant -- all this seems a triumph of art , a rather desperate art , in itself ; ; beyond itself , also , it evokes numerous and distant resonances from the entire body of Mann's work . When I try to work out my reasons for feeling that this passage is of critical significance , I come up with the following ideas , which I shall express very briefly here and revert to in a later essay . Love is the crucial dilemma of experience for Mann's heroes . The dramatic construction of his stories characteristically turns on a situation in which someone is simultaneously compelled and forbidden to love . The release , the freedom , involved in loving another is either terribly difficult or else absolutely impossible ; ; and the motion toward it brings disaster . This prohibition on love has an especially poignant relation to art ; ; it is particularly the artist ( Tonio Kroger , Aschenbach , Leverkuhn ) who suffers from it . The specific analogy to the dilemma of love is the problem of the `` breakthrough '' in the realm of art . Again , the sufferings and disasters produced by any transgression against the commandment not to love are almost invariably associated in one way or another with childhood , with the figure of a child . Finally , the theatrical ( and perversely erotic ) notions of dressing up , cosmetics , disguise , and especially change of costume ( or singularity of costume , as with Cipolla ) , are characteristically associated with the catastrophes of Mann's stories . We shall return to these statements and deal with them more fully as the evidence for them accumulates . For the present it is enough to note that in the grotesque figure of Jacoby , at the moment of his collapse , all these elements come together in prophetic parody . Professionally a lawyer , that is to say associated with dignity , reserve , discipline , with much that is essentially middle-class , he is compelled by an impossible love to exhibit himself dressed up , disguised -- that is , paradoxically , revealed -- as a child , and , worse , as a whore masquerading as a child . That this abandonment takes place on a stage , during an ' artistic ' performance , is enough to associate Jacoby with art , and to bring down upon him the punishment for art ; ; that is , he is suspect , guilty , punishable , as is anyone in Mann's stories who produces illusion , and this is true even though the constant elements of the artist-nature , technique , magic , guilt and suffering , are divided in this story between Jacoby and Lautner . It appears that the dominant tendency of Mann's early tales , however pictorial or even picturesque the surface , is already toward the symbolic , the emblematic , the expressionistic . In a certain perfectly definite way , the method and the theme of his stories are one and the same . Something of this can be learned from `` The Way To The Churchyard '' ( 1901 ) , an anecdote about an old failure whose fit of anger at a passing cyclist causes him to die of a stroke or seizure . There is no more `` plot '' than that ; ; only slightly more , perhaps , than a newspaper account of such an incident would give . The artistic interest , then , lies in what the encounter may be made to represent , in the power of some central significance to draw the details into relevance and meaningfulness . The first sentence , with its platitudinous irony , announces an emblematic intent : `` The way to the churchyard ran along beside the highroad , ran beside it all the way to the end ; ; that is to say , to the churchyard '' . And the action is consistently presented with regard for this distinction . The highroad , one might say at first , belongs to life , while the way to the churchyard belongs to death . But that is too simple , and won't hold up . As the first sentence suggests , both roads belong to death in the end . But the highroad , according to the description of its traffic , belongs to life as it is lived in unawareness of death , while the way to the churchyard belongs to some other sort of life : a suffering form , an existence wholly comprised in the awareness of death . Thus , on the highroad , a troop of soldiers `` marched in their own dust and sang '' , while on the footpath one man walks alone . This man's isolation is not merely momentary , it is permanent . He is a widower , his three children are dead , he has no one left on earth ; ; also he is a drunk , and has lost his job on that account . His name is Praisegod Piepsam , and he is rather fully described as to his clothing and physiognomy in a way which relates him to a sinister type in the author's repertory -- he is a forerunner of those enigmatic strangers in `` Death In Venice '' , for example , who represent some combination of cadaver , exotic , and psychopomp . This strange person quarrels with a cyclist because the latter is using the path rather than the highroad . The cyclist , a sufficiently commonplace young fellow , is not named but identified simply as `` Life '' -- that and a license number , which Piepsam uses in addressing him . `` Life '' points out that `` everybody uses this path '' , and starts to ride on . Piepsam tries to stop him by force , receives a push in the chest from `` Life '' , and is left standing in impotent and growing rage , while a crowd begins to gather . His rage assumes a religious form ; ; that is , on the basis of his own sinfulness and abject wretchedness , Piepsam becomes a prophet who in his ecstasy and in the name of God imprecates doom on Life -- not only the cyclist now , but the audience , the world , as well : `` all you light-headed breed '' . This passion brings on a fit which proves fatal . Then an ambulance comes along , and they drive Praisegod Piepsam away . This is simple enough , but several more points of interest may be mentioned as relevant . The season , between spring and summer , belongs to life in its carefree aspect . Piepsam's fatal rage arises not only because he cannot stop the cyclist , but also because God will not stop him ; ; as Piepsam says to the crowd in his last moments : `` His justice is not of this world '' . Life is further characterized , in antithesis to Piepsam , as animal : the image of a dog , which appears at several places , is first given as the criterion of amiable , irrelevant interest aroused by life considered simply as a spectacle : a dog in a wagon is `` admirable '' , `` a pleasure to contemplate '' ; ; another wagon has no dog , and therefore is `` devoid of interest '' . Piepsam calls the cyclist `` cur '' and `` puppy '' among other things , and at the crisis of his fit a little fox-terrier stands before him and howls into his face . The ambulance is drawn by two `` charming '' little horses . Piepsam is not , certainly , religious in any conventional sense . His religiousness is intimately , or dialectically , connected with his sinfulness ; ; the two may in fact be identical . His unsuccessful strivings to give up drink are represented as religious strivings ; ; he keeps a bottle in a wardrobe at home , and `` before this wardrobe Praisegod Piepsam had before now gone literally on his knees , and in his wrestlings had bitten his tongue -- and still in the end capitulated '' . The cyclist , by contrast , blond and blue-eyed , is simply unreflective , unproblematic Life , `` blithe and carefree '' . `` He made no claims to belong to the great and mighty of this earth '' . Piepsam is grotesque , a disturbing parody ; ; his end is ridiculous and trivial . He is `` a man raving mad on the way to the churchyard '' . But he is more interesting than the others , the ones who come from the highroad to watch him , more interesting than Life considered as a cyclist . And if I have gone into so much detail about so small a work , that is because it is also so typical a work , representing the germinal form of a conflict which remains essential in Mann's writing : the crude sketch of Piepsam contains , in its critical , destructive and self-destructive tendencies , much that is enlarged and illuminated in the figures of , for instance , Naphta and Leverkuhn . In method as well as in theme this little anecdote with its details selected as much for expressiveness and allegory as for `` realism '' , anticipates a kind of musical composition , as well as a kind of fictional composition , in which , as Leverkuhn says , `` there shall be nothing unthematic '' . It resembles , too , pictures such as Durer and Bruegel did , in which all that looks at first to be solely pictorial proves on inspection to be also literary , the representation of a proverb , for example , or a deadly sin . `` Gladius Dei '' ( 1902 ) resembles `` The Way To The Churchyard '' in its representation of a conflict between light and dark , between `` Life '' and a spirit of criticism , negation , melancholy , but it goes considerably further in characterizing the elements of this conflict . The monk Savonarola , brought over from the Renaissance and placed against the background of Munich at the turn of the century , protests against the luxurious works displayed in the art-shop of M. Bluthenzweig ; ; in particular against a Madonna portrayed in a voluptuous style and modeled , according to gossip , upon the painter's mistress . Hieronymus , like Piepsam , makes his protest quite in vain , and his rejection , though not fatal , is ridiculous and humiliating ; ; he is simply thrown out of the shop by the porter . On the street outside , Hieronymus envisions a holocaust of the vanities of this world , such a burning of artistic and erotic productions as his namesake actually brought to pass in Florence , and prophetically he issues his curse : `` Gladius Dei super terram cito et velociter '' . The `` reality '' to which they respond is rationally empty and their art is an imitation of the inescapable powerfulness of this unknown and empty world . Their artistic rationale is given to the witness of unreason . These polar concerns ( imitation vs. formalism ) reflect a philosophical and religious situation which has been developing over a long period of time . The breakdown of classical structures of meaning in all realms of western culture has given rise to several generations of artists who have documented the disintegrative processes . Thus the image of man has suffered complete fragmentation in personal and spiritual qualities , and complete objectification in sub-human and quasi-mechanistic powers . The image of the world tends to reflect the hostility and indifference of man or else to dissolve into empty spaces and overwhelming mystery . The image of God has simply disappeared . All such imitations of negative quality have given rise to a compensatory response in the form of a heroic and highly individualistic humanism : if man can neither know nor love reality as it is , he can at least invent an artistic `` reality '' which is its own world and which can speak to man of purely personal and subjective qualities capable of being known and worthy of being loved . The person of the artist becomes a final bastion of meaning in a world rendered meaningless by the march of events and the decay of classical religious and philosophical systems . Whatever pole of this contrast one emphasizes and whatever the tension between these two approaches to understanding the artistic imagination , it will be readily seen that they are not mutually exclusive , that they belong together . Without the decay of a sense of objective reference ( except as the imitation of mystery ) , the stress on subjective invention would never have been stimulated into being . And although these insights into the nature of art may be in themselves insufficient for a thoroughgoing philosophy of art , their peculiar authenticity in this day and age requires that they be taken seriously and gives promise that from their very substance , new and valid chapters in the philosophy of art may be written . For better or worse we cannot regard `` imitation '' in the arts in the simple mode of classical rationalism or detached realism . A broader concept of imitation is needed , one which acknowledges that true invention is important , that the artist's creativity in part transcends the non-artistic causal factors out of which it arises . On the other hand , we cannot regard artistic invention as pure , uncaused , and unrelated to the times in which it occurs . We need a doctrine of imitation to save us from the solipsism and futility of pure formalism . Accordingly , it is the aim of this essay to advance a new theory of imitation ( which I shall call mimesis in order to distinguish it from earlier theories of imitation ) and a new theory of invention ( which I shall call symbol for reasons to be stated hereafter ) . The mimetic imagination in the arts The word `` mimesis '' ( `` imitation '' ) is usually associated with Plato and Aristotle . For Plato , `` imitation '' is twice removed from reality , being a poor copy of physical appearance , which in itself is a poor copy of ideal essence . All artistic and mythological representations , therefore , are `` imitations of imitations '' and are completely superseded by the truth value of `` dialectic '' , the proper use of the inquiring intellect . In Plato's judgment , the arts play a meaningful role in society only in the education of the young , prior to the full development of their intellectual powers . Presupposed in Plato's system is a doctrine of levels of insight , in which a certain kind of detached understanding is alone capable of penetrating to the most sublime wisdom . Aristotle also tended to stratify all aspects of human nature and activity into levels of excellence and , like Plato , he put the pure and unimpassioned intellect on the top level . The Poetics , in affirming that all human arts are `` modes of imitation '' , gives a more serious role to artistic mimesis than did Plato . But Aristotle kept the principle of levels and even augmented it by describing in the Poetics what kinds of character and action must be imitated if the play is to be a vehicle of serious and important human truths . For both Plato and Aristotle artistic mimesis , in contrast to the power of dialectic , is relatively incapable of expressing the character of fundamental reality . The central concern of Erich Auerbach's impressive volume called Mimesis is to describe the shift from a classic theory of imitation ( based upon a recognition of levels of truth ) to a Christian theory of imitation in which the levels are dissolved . Following the theme of Incarnation in the Gospels , the Christian artist and critic sees in the most commonplace and ordinary events `` figures '' of divine power and reality . Here artistic realism involves the audience in an impassioned participation in events whose overtones and implications are transcendent . Artistic mimesis under Christian influence records the involvement of all persons , however humble , in a divine drama . The artist , unlike the philosopher , is not a removed observer aiming at neutral and rarified high levels of abstraction . He is the conveyor of a sacred reality by which he has been grasped . I have chosen to use the word `` mimesis '' in its Christian rather than its classic implications and to discover in the concrete forms of both art and myth powers of theological expression which , as in the Christian mind , are the direct consequence of involvement in historical experience , which are not reserved , as in the Greek mind , only to moments of theoretical reflection . In the first instance , `` mimesis '' is here used to mean the recalling of experience in terms of vivid images rather than in terms of abstract ideas or conventional designations . By `` image '' is meant not only a visual presentation , but also remembered sensations of any of the five senses plus the feelings which are immediately conjoined therewith . This is the primary function of the imagination operating in the absence of the original experiential stimulus by which the images were first appropriated . Mimesis is the nearest possible thing to the actual re-living of experience , in which the imagining person recovers through images something of the force and depth characteristic of experience itself . The images themselves , like their counterparts in experience , are not neutral qualities to be surveyed dispassionately ; ; they are fields of force exerting a unique influence on the sensibilities and a unique relatedness to one another . They bring an inextricable component of value within themselves , with attractions and repulsions native to their own quality . As in experience one is seized by given entities and their interrelations and is forced to respond in value feelings to them , so one is similarly seized in the mimetic presentation of images . Mimesis here is not to be confused with literalism or realism in the conventional sense . A word taken in its dictionary meaning , a photographic image of a recognizable object , the mere picturing of a `` scene '' tends to lose experiential vividness and to connote such conventional abstractions as to invite neutral reception without the incitement of value feelings . Similarly experience itself can be conventionalized so that people react to certain preconceived clues for behavior without awareness of the vitality of their experiential field . A truly vivid imagination moves beyond the conventional recollection to a sense of immediacy . The mimetic character of the imaginative consciousness tends to express itself in the presentation of artistic forms and materials . When words can be used in a more fresh and primitive way so that they strike with the force of sights and sounds , when tones of sound and colors of paint and the carven shape all strike the sensibilities with an undeniable force of data in and of themselves , compelling the observer into an attitude of attention , all this imitates the way experience itself in its deepest character strikes upon the door of consciousness and clamors for entrance . These are like the initial ways in which the world forces itself upon the self and thrusts the self into decision and choice . The presence of genuine mimesis in art is marked by the persistence with which the work demands attention and compels valuation even though it is but vaguely understood . Underlying these conceptions of mimesis are certain presuppositions concerning the nature of primary human experience which require some exposition before the main argument can proceed . Experience is not seen , as it is in classical rationalism , as presenting us initially with clear and distinct objects simply located in space and registering their character , movements , and changes on the tabula rasa of an uninvolved intellect . Neither is primary experience understood according to the attitude of modern empiricism in which nothing is thought to be received other than signals of sensory qualities producing their responses in the appropriate sense organs . Primary feelings of the world come neither as a collection of clearly known objects ( houses , trees , implements , etc. ) nor a collection of isolated and neutral sensory qualities . In contrast to all this , primary data are data of a self involved in environing processes and powers . The most primitive feelings are rudimentary value feelings , both positive and negative : a desire to appropriate this or that part of the environment into oneself ; ; a desire to avoid and repel this or that other part . These desires presuppose a sense of causally efficacious powers in which one is involved , some working for one's good , others threatening ill . Gone is the tabula rasa of the mind . In its place is a passionate consciousness grasped and molded to feelings of positive or negative values even as the actions of one's life are determined by constellations of process in which one is caught . The principal defender of this view of primary experience as `` causal efficacy '' is Alfred North Whitehead . Our most elemental and unavoidable impressions , he says , are those of being involved in a large arena of powers which have a longer past than our own , which are interrelated in a vast movement through the present toward the future . We feel the quality of these powers initially as in some degree wholesome or threatening . Later abstractive and rational processes may indicate errors of judgment in these apprehensions of value , but the apprehensions themselves are the primary stuff of experience . It takes a great deal of abstraction to free oneself from the primitive impression of larger unities of power and influence and to view one's world simply as a collection of sense data arranged in such and such sequence and pattern , devoid of all power to move the feelings and actions except in so far as they present themselves for inspection . Whitehead is here questioning David Hume's understanding of the nature of experience ; ; he is questioning , also , every epistemology which stems from Hume's presupposition that experience is merely sense data in abstraction from causal efficacy , and that causal efficacy is something intellectually imputed to the world , not directly perceived . What Hume calls `` sensation '' is what Whitehead calls `` perception in the mode of presentational immediacy '' which is a sophisticated abstraction from perception in the mode of causal efficacy . As long as perception is seen as composed only of isolated sense data , most of the quality and interconnectedness of existence loses its objectivity , becomes an invention of consciousness , and the result is a philosophical scepticism . Whitehead contends that the human way of understanding existence as a unity of interlocking and interdependent processes which constitute each other and which cause each other to be and not to be is possible only because the basic form of such an understanding , for all its vagueness and tendency to mistake the detail , is initially given in the way man feels the world . In this respect experience is broader and full of a richer variety of potential meanings than the mind of man or any of his arts or culture are capable of making clear and distinct . A chief characteristic of experience in the mode of causal efficacy is one of derivation from the past . Both I and my feelings come up out of a chain of events that fan out into the past into sources that are ultimately very unlike the entity which I now am . After only eighteen years of non-interference , there were already indications of melioration , though `` in a slight degree '' , to be sure . There were more indications by the mid-twentieth century . I leave it to the statisticians to say what they were , but I noticed several a few years ago , during an automobile ride from Memphis to Hattiesburg . In town after town my companion pointed out the Negro school and the White school , and in every instance the former made a better appearance ( it was newer , for one thing ) . It really looked as if a change of the sort predicted by Booker T. Washington had been going on . But with the renewal of interference in 1954 ( as with its beginning in 1835 ) , the improvement was impaired . For over a hundred years Southerners have felt that the North was picking on them . It's infuriating , this feeling that one is being picked on , continually , constantly . By what right of superior virtue , Southerners ask , do the people of the North do this ? The traditional strategy of the South has been to expose the vices of the North , to demonstrate that the North possessed no superior virtue , to `` show the world that '' as James's Christopher Newman said to his adversaries ) `` however bad I may be , you're not quite the people to say it '' . In the pre-Civil War years , the South argued that the slave was not less humanely treated than the factory worker of the North . At the present time , the counter-attack takes the line that there's no more of the true spirit of `` integration '' in the North than in the South . The line is a pretty good one . People talk about `` the law of the land '' . The expression has become quite a cliche . But people can't be made to integrate , socialize ( the two are inseparable by Southern standards ) by law . I was having lunch not long ago ( apologies to N. V. Peale ) with three distinguished historians ( one specializing in the European Middle Ages , one in American history , and one in the Far East ) , and I asked them if they could name instances where the general mores had been radically changed with `` deliberate speed , majestic instancy '' ( Francis Thompson's words for the Hound Of Heaven's Pursuit ) by judicial fiat . They didn't seem to be able to think of any . A Virginia judge a while back cited a Roman jurist to the effect that ten years might be a reasonable length of time for such a change . But I suspect that the old Roman was referring to change made under military occupation -- the sort of change which Tacitus was talking about when he said , `` They make a desert , and call it peace '' ( `` Solitudinem faciunt , pacem appellant '' . ) . Moreover , the law of the land is not irrevocable ; ; it can be changed ; ; it has been , many times . Mr. Justice Taney's Dred Scott decision in 1857 was unpopular in the North , and soon became a dead letter . Prohibition was the law of the land , but it was unpopular ( how many of us oldsters took up drinking in prohibition days , drinking was so gay , so fashionable , especially in the sophisticated Northeast ! ) and was repealed . The cliche loses its talismanic virtue in the light of a little history . The Declaration of Independence says that `` governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed '' . The phrase `` consent of the governed '' needs a hard look . How do we define it '' ? Is the consent of the governed a numerical majority ? Calhoun dealt with this question in his `` Disquisition On Government '' . To guard against the tyranny of a numerical majority , Calhoun developed his theory of `` concurrent majority '' , which , he said , `` by giving to each portion of the community which may be unequally affected by the action of government , a negative on the others , prevents all partial or local legislation '' . Who will say that our country is even now a homogeneous community ? That regional peculiarities do not still exist ? That the Court order does not unequally affect the Southern region ? Who will deny that in a vast portion of the South the Federal action is incompatible with the Jeffersonian concept of `` the consent of the governed '' ? Circumstances alter cases . A friend of mine in New Mexico said the Court order had caused no particular trouble out there , that all had gone as merry as a marriage bell . He seemed a little surprised that it should have caused any particular trouble anywhere . I murmured something about a possible difference between New Mexico's history and Mississippi's . One can meet with aloofness almost anywhere : the THIDIU viewpoint , It Doesn't Affect Us ! Southern Liberals ( there are a good many ) -- especially if they're rich -- often exhibit blithe insouciance . The trouble here is that it's almost too easy to take the high moral ground when it doesn't cost you anything . You've already sent your daughter to Miss X's select academy for girls and your son to Mr. Y's select academy for boys , and you can be as liberal as you please with strict impunity . If there's no suitable academy in your own neighborhood , there's always New England . New England academies welcome fugitives from the provinces , South as well as West . They may even enroll a colored student or two for show , though he usually turns out to be from Thailand , or any place other than the American South . It would be interesting to know how much `` integration '' there is in the famous , fashionable colleges and prep schools of New England . A recent newspaper report said there were five Negroes in the 1960 graduating class of nearly one thousand at Yale ; ; that is , about one-half of one per cent , which looks pretty `` tokenish '' to me , especially in an institution which professes to be `` national '' . I must confess that I prefer the Liberal who is personally affected , who is willing to send his own children to a mixed school as proof of his faith . I leave out of account the question of the best interests of the children , the question of what their best interests really are . I'm talking about the grand manner of the Liberal -- North and South -- who is not affected personally . If these people were denied a voice ( do they have a moral right to a voice ? ) , what voices would be left ? Who is involved willy nilly ? Well , after everybody has followed the New England pattern of segregating one's children into private schools , only the poor folks are left . And it is precisely in this poorer economic class that one finds , and has always found , the most racial friction . A dear , respected friend of mine , who like myself grew up in the South and has spent many years in New England , said to me not long ago : `` I can't forgive New England for rejecting all complicity '' . Being a teacher of American literature , I remembered Whittier's `` Massachusetts To Virginia '' , where he said : `` But that one dark loathsome burden ye must stagger with alone , And reap the bitter harvest which ye yourselves have sown '' . There is a legend ( Hawthorne records it in his `` English Notebooks '' . And one finds it again in Thomas Nelson Page ) to the effect that the Mayflower on its second voyage brought a cargo of Negro slaves . Whether historically a fact or not , the legend has a certain symbolic value . Complicity is an embarrassing word . It is something which most of us try to get out from under . Like the cowboy in Stephen Crane's `` Blue Hotel '' , we run around crying , `` Well , I didn't do anything , did I '' ? Robert Penn Warren puts it this way in `` Brother To Dragons '' : `` The recognition of complicity is the beginning of innocence '' , where innocence , I think , means about the same thing as redemption . A man must be able to say , `` Father , I have sinned '' , or there is no hope for him . Lincoln understood this better than most when he said in his `` Second Inaugural '' that God `` gives to both North and South this terrible war , as the woe due to those by whom the offense came '' . He also spoke of `` the wealth piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years in unrequited toil '' . Lincoln was historian and economist enough to know that a substantial portion of this wealth had accumulated in the hands of the descendants of New Englanders engaged in the slave trade . After how many generations is such wealth ( mounting all the while through the manipulations of high finance ) purified of taint ? It is a question which New Englanders long ago put out of their minds . But didn't they get off too easy ? The slaves never shared in their profits , while they did share , in a very real sense , in the profits of the slave-owners : they were fed , clothed , doctored , and so forth ; ; they were the beneficiaries of responsible , paternalistic care . Emerson -- Platonist , idealist , doctrinaire -- sounded a high Transcendental note in his `` Boston Hymn '' , delivered in 1863 in the Boston Music Hall amidst thundering applause : `` Pay ransom to the owner and fill the bag to the brim . Who is the owner ? The slave is owner , And ever was . Pay him '' ! It is the abstractionism , the unrealism , of the pure idealist . It ignores the sordid financial aspects ( quite conveniently , too , for his audience , who could indulge in moral indignation without visible , or even conscious , discomfort , their money from the transaction having been put away long ago in a good antiseptic brokerage ) . Like Pilate , they had washed their hands . But can one , really ? Can God be mocked , ever , in the long run ? New Englanders were a bit sensitive on the subject of their complicity in Negro slavery at the time of the drafting of the Declaration of Independence , as Jefferson explained in his `` Autobiography '' : `` The clause reprobating the enslaving the inhabitants of Africa was struck out in complaisance to South Carolina and Georgia , who had never attempted to restrain the importation of slaves , and who on the contrary still wished to continue it . Our Northern brethren also I believe felt a little tender under those censures ; ; for though their people had very few slaves themselves , yet they had been pretty considerable carriers of them to others '' . But that was a long time ago . The New England conscience became desensitized . George W. Cable ( naturalized New Englander ) , writing in 1889 from `` Paradise Road , Northampton '' ( lovely symbolic name ) , agitated continuously the `` Southern question '' . It was nice to be able to isolate it . New England , as everyone knows , has long been schoolmaster to the Nation . There one finds concentrated in a comparatively small area the chief universities , colleges , and preparatory schools of the United States . Why should this be so ? It is true that New England , more than any other section , was dedicated to education from the start . But I think that something more than this is involved . How did it happen , for example , that the state university , that great symbol of American democracy , failed to flourish in New England as it did in other parts of the country ? Isn't it a bit odd that the three states of Southern New England ( Massachusetts , Connecticut , and Rhode Island ) have had state institutions of university status only in the very recent past , these institutions having previously been A & M colleges ? Was it supposed , perchance , that A & M ( vocational training , that is ) was quite sufficient for the immigrant class which flooded that part of the New England world in the post-Civil War period , the immigrants having been brought in from Southern Europe , to work in the mills , to make up for the labor shortage caused by migration to the West ? Is it not ironical that Roger Williams's state , Rhode Island , should have been the very last of the forty-eight to establish a state university ? The state universities of Maine , New Hampshire , And Vermont are older and more `` respectable '' ; ; they had less immigration to contend with . A Yale historian , writing a few years ago in The Yale Review , said : `` We in New England have long since segregated our children '' . He was referring not only to the general college situation but more especially to the preparatory schools . And what a galaxy of those adorns that fair land ! I don't propose to go into their history , but I have one or two surmises . One is that they were established , or gained eminence , under pressure provided by these same immigrants , from whom the old families wished to segregate their children . In the early days of a homogeneous population , the public school was quite satisfactory . Among the recipients of the Nobel Prize for Literature more than half are practically unknown to readers of English . Of these there are surely few that would be more rewarding discoveries than Verner Von Heidenstam , the Swedish poet and novelist who received the award in 1916 and whose centennial was celebrated two years ago . Equally a master of prose and verse , he recreates the glory of Sweden in the past and continues it into the present . In the following sketch we shall present a brief outline of his life and let him as much as possible speak for himself . Heidenstam was born in 1859 , of a prosperous family . On his father's side he was of German descent , on his mother's he came of the old Swedish nobility . The family estate was situated near Vadstena on Lake Vattern in south central Sweden . It is a lonely , rather desolate region , but full of legendary and historic associations . As a boy in a local school he was shy and solitary , absorbed in his fondness for nature and his visions of Sweden's ancient glory . He liked to fancy himself as a chieftain and to dress for the part . Being somewhat delicate in health , at the age of sixteen he was sent to Southern Europe , for which he at once developed a passion , so that he spent nearly all of the following ten years abroad , at first in Italy , then in Greece , Egypt , Asia Minor , and Palestine . In one of his summers at home he married , to the great disapproval of his father , who objected because of his extreme youth . Deciding to become a painter , he entered the studio of Gerome in Paris , where he enjoyed the life of the artists , but soon found that whatever talent he might have did not lie in that direction . He gives us an account of this in his lively and humorous poem , `` The Happy Artists '' . `` I scanned the world through printed symbol swart , And through the beggar's rags I strove to see The inner man . I looked unceasingly With my cold mind and with my burning heart '' . In this final line , we have the key to his nature . Few writers have better understood their deepest selves . Heidenstam could never be satisfied by surface . It may , however , be noted that his gift for color and imagery must have been greatly stimulated by his stay in Paris . The first result of Heidenstam's long sojourn abroad was a volume of poems , Pilgrimage And Wander-Years ( Vallfart och Vandringsar ) , published in 1888 . It was a brilliant debut , so much so indeed that it aroused a new vitality in the younger poets , as did Byron's Childe Harold . Professor Fredrik Book , Sweden's foremost critic of the period , acclaims it as follows : `` In this we have the verse of a painter ; ; strongly colorful , plastic , racy , vivid . In a bold , sometimes careless , form there is nothing academic ; ; all is seen and felt and experienced , the observation is sharp and the imagination lively . The young poet-painter reproduces the French life of the streets ; ; he tells stories of the Thousand and One Nights , and conjures up before us the bazaars of Damascus . In the care-free indolence of the East he sees the last reflection of the old happy existence , and for that reason he loves it . And yet amid all the gay hedonism in Pilgrimage And Wander-Years is a cycle of short poems , `` Thoughts In Loneliness '' , filled with brooding , melancholy , and sombre longing '' . Of the longer pieces of the volume none is so memorable as `` Nameless And Immortal '' , which at once took rank among the finest poems ever written in the Swedish language . It celebrates the unknown architect who designed the temple of Neptune at Paestum , next to the Parthenon the noblest example of Grecian classic style now in existence . On the eve of his return to their native Naxos he speaks with his wife of the masterpiece which rises before them in its completed perfection . The supreme object of their lives is now fulfilled , says the wife , her husband has achieved immortality . Not so , he answers , it is not the architect but the temple that is immortal . `` The man's true reputation is his work '' . The short poems grouped at the end of the volume as `` Thoughts in Loneliness '' is , as Professor Book indicated , in sharp contrast with the others . It consists of fragmentary personal revelations , such as `` The Spark '' : `` There is a spark dwells deep within my soul . To get it out into the daylight's glow Is my life's aim both first and last , the whole . It slips away , it burns and tortures me . That little spark is all the wealth I know , That little spark is my life's misery '' . A dominant motive is the poet's longing for his homeland and its boyhood associations : `` Not men-folk , but the fields where I would stray , The stones where as a child I used to play '' . He is utterly disappointed in himself and in the desultory life he has been leading . What he really wants is to find `` a sacred cause '' to which he can honestly devote himself . This restless individualism found its answer when he returned to live nearly all the rest of his life in Sweden . His cause was to commemorate the glory of her past and to incite her people to perpetuate it in the present . He did not , however , find himself at once . His next major work , completed in 1892 , was a long fantastic epic in prose , entitled Hans Alienus , which Professor Book describes as a monument on the grave of his carefree and indolent youth . The hero , who is himself , is represented as a pilgrim in the storied lands of the East , a sort of Faustus type , who , to quote from Professor Book again , `` even in the pleasure gardens of Sardanapalus can not cease from his painful search after the meaning of life . He is driven back by his yearning to the wintry homeland of his fathers in the forest of Tiveden '' . From this time on Heidenstam proceeded to find his deeper self . By the death of his father in 1888 he had come into possession of the family estate and had re-assumed its traditions . He did not , however , settle back into acquiescence with things as they were . Like his friend and contemporary August Strindberg he had little patience with collective mediocrity . He saw Sweden as a country of smug and narrow provincialism , indifferent to the heroic spirit of its former glory . Strindberg's remedy for this condition was to tear down the old structures and build anew from the ground up . Heidenstam's conception , on the contrary , was to revive the present by the memories of the past . Whether in prose or poetry , all of Heidenstam's later work was concerned with Sweden . With the first of a group of historical novels , The Charles Men ( Karolinerna ) , published in 1897-8 , he achieved the masterpiece of his career . In scope and power it can only be compared to Tolstoy's War And Peace . About one-third as long , it is less intimate and detailed , but better coordinated , more concise and more dramatic . Though it centers around the brilliant and enigmatic figure of Charles 12 , , the true hero is not finally the king himself . Hence the title of the book , referring to the soldiers and subjects of the king ; ; on the fatal battlefield of Poltava , to quote from the novel , `` the wreath he twined for himself slipped down upon his people '' . The Charles Men consists not of a connected narrative but of a group of short stories , each depicting a special phase of the general subject . Somewhat uneven in interest for an average reader , eight or ten of these are among the finest of their kind in literature . They comprise a great variety of scene and interest : grim episodes of war , idyllic interludes , superb canvases of world-shaking events , and delightfully humorous sketches of odd characters . The general effect is tragic . Almost nothing is said of Charles' spectacular victories , the central theme being the heroic loyalty of the Swedish people to their idolized king in misfortune and defeat . To carry out this exalted conception the author has combined the vivid realism and imaginative power we have noticed in his early poetry and carried them out on a grand scale . His peculiar gift , as had been suggested before , is his intensity . George Meredith has said that fervor is the core of style . Of few authors is this more true than of Heidenstam . The Charles Men has a tremendous range of characters , of common folk even more than of major figures . The career of Charles 12 , is obviously very similar to that of Napoleon . His ideal was Alexander of Macedon , as Napoleon's was Julius Caesar . His purpose , however , was not to establish an empire , but to assert the principle of divine justice . Each aspired to be a god in human form , but with each it was a different kind of god . Each failed catastrophically in an invasion of Russia and each brought ruin on the country that worshipped him . Each is still glorified as a national hero . The first half of The Charles Men , ending on the climax of the battle of Poltava in 1709 , is more dramatically coherent than the second . After the collapse of that desperate and ill-fated campaign the character of the king degenerated for a time into a futility that was not merely pitiable but often ridiculous . Like Napoleon , he was the worst of losers . There are , however , some wonderful chapters at the beginning of the second part , concerning the reactions of the Swedes in adversity . Then more than ever before did they show their fortitude and patient cheerfulness . This comes out in `` When The Bells Ring '' , which describes the rallying of the peasants in southern Sweden to repel an invasion by the Danes . In `` The King's Ride '' , Charles breaks out of a long period of petulance and inertia , regains his old self , escapes from Turkey , and finally reaches his own land after an absence of eighteen years . He finds it in utter misery and desolation . All his people ask for is no more war . But he plunges into yet another , this time with Norway , and is killed in an assault on the fortress of Fredrikshall , being only thirty-six years of age when he died . He had become king at fifteen . Then suddenly there was a tremendous revulsion of popular feeling . From being a hated tyrant and madman he was now the symbol of all that was noblest and best in the history of Sweden . This is brought out in the next to last chapter of the book , `` A Hero's Funeral '' , written in the form of an impassioned prose poem . Slowly the procession of warriors and statesmen passes through the snow beside the black water and into the brilliantly lighted cathedral , the shrine of so many precious memories . The guns are fired , the hymns are sung , and the body of Charles is carried down to the vault and laid beside the tombs of his ancestors . As he had longed to be , he became the echo of a saga . Heidenstam wrote four other works of fiction about earlier figures revered in Swedish memory . Excellent in their way , they lack the wide appeal of The Charles Men , and need not detain us here . It is different with his volume The Swedes And Their Chieftains ( Svenskarna och deras Hovdingar ) , a history intended for the general reader and particularly suited for high school students . Admirably written , it is a perfect introduction to Swedish history for readers of other countries . Some of the earlier episodes have touches of the supernatural , as suited to the legendary background . These are suggestive of Selma Lagerlof . Especially touching is the chapter , `` The Little Sister '' , about a king's daughter who became a nun in the convent of St. Birgitta . The record teems with romance and adventure . Gustaf Vasa is a superb example , and Charles 10 , , the conqueror of Denmark , hardly less so . Of Gustavus Adolphus and Charles 12 , it is unnecessary to speak . Today the private detective will also investigate insurance claims or handle divorce cases , but his primary function remains what it has always been , to assist those who have money in their unending struggle with those who have not . It is from this unpromising background that the fictional private detective was recruited . The mythological private eye differs from his counterpart in real life in two essential ways . On the one hand , he does not work for a large agency , but is almost always self-employed . As a free-lance investigator , the fictional detective is responsible to no one but himself and his client . For this reason , he appears as an independent and self-reliant figure , whose rugged individualism need not be pressed into the mold of a 9 to 5 routine . On the other hand , the fictional detective does not break strikes or handle divorce cases ; ; no client would ever think of asking him to do such things . Whatever his original assignment , the fictional private eye ends up by investigating and solving a crime , usually a murder . Operating as a one man police force in fact if not in name , he is at once more independent and more dedicated than the police themselves . He catches criminals not merely because he is paid to do so ( frequently he does not receive a fee at all ) , but because he enjoys his work , because he firmly believes that murder must be punished . Thus the fictional detective is much more than a simple businessman . He is , first and foremost , a defender of public morals , a servant of society . It is this curious blend of rugged individualism and public service which accounts for the great appeal of the mythological detective . By virtue of his self-reliance , his individualism and his freedom from external restraint , the private eye is a perfect embodiment of the middle class conception of liberty , which amounts to doing what you please and let the devil take the hindmost . At the same time , because the personal code of the detective coincides with the legal dictates of his society , because he likes to catch criminals , he is in middle class eyes a virtuous man . In this way , the private detective gets the best of two possible worlds . He is an individualist but not an anarchist ; ; he is a public servant but not a cop . In short , the fictional private eye is a specialized version of Adam Smith's ideal entrepreneur , the man whose private ambitions must always and everywhere promote the public welfare . In the mystery story , as in The Wealth of Nations , individualism and the social good are two sides of the same benevolent coin . There is only one catch to this idyllic arrangement : Adam Smith was wrong . Not only did the ideal entrepreneur not produce the greatest good for the greatest number , he ended by destroying himself , by giving birth to monopoly capitalism . The rise of the giant corporations in Western Europe and the United States dates from the period 1880-1900 . Now , although the roots of the mystery story in serious literature go back as far as Balzac , Dickens , and Poe , it was not until the closing decades of the 19th century that the private detective became an established figure in popular fiction . Sherlock Holmes , the ancestor of all private eyes , was born during the 1890s . Thus the transformation of Adam Smith's ideal entrepreneur into a mythological detective coincides closely with the decline of the real entrepreneur in economic life . Driven from the marketplace by the course of history , our hero disguises himself as a private detective . The birth of the myth compensates for the death of the ideal . Even on the fictional level , however , the contradictions which give rise to the mystery story are not fully resolved . The individualism and public service of the private detective both stem from his dedication to a personal code of conduct : he enforces the law without being told to do so . The private eye is therefore a moral man ; ; but his morality rests upon that of his society . The basic premise of all mystery stories is that the distinction between good and bad coincides with the distinction between legal and illegal . Unfortunately , this assumption does not always hold good . As capitalism in the 20th century has become increasingly dependent upon force and violence for its survival , the private detective is placed in a serious dilemma . If he is good , he may not be legal ; ; if he is legal , he may not be good . It is the gradual unfolding and deepening of this contradiction which creates the inner dialectic of the evolution of the mystery story . With the advent of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes , the development of the modern private detective begins . Sherlock Holmes is not merely an individualist ; ; he is very close to being a mental case . A brief list of the great detective's little idiosyncrasies would provide Dr. Freud with ample food for thought . Holmes is addicted to the use of cocaine and other refreshing stimulants ; ; he is prone to semi-catatonic trances induced by the playing of the vioiln ; ; he is a recluse , an incredible egotist , a confirmed misogynist . Holmes rebels against the social conventions of his day not on moral but rather on aesthetic grounds . His eccentricity begins as a defense against boredom . It was in order to avoid the stuffy routine of middle class life that Holmes became a detective in the first place . As he informs Watson , `` My life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence . These little problems help me to do so '' . Holmes is a public servant , to be sure ; ; but the society which he serves bores him to tears . The curious relationship between Holmes and Scotland Yard provides an important clue to the deeper significance of his eccentric behavior . Although he is perfectly willing to cooperate with Scotland Yard , Holmes has nothing but contempt for the intelligence and mentality of the police . They for their part are convinced that Holmes is too `` unorthodox '' and `` theoretical '' to make a good detective . Why do the police find Holmes `` unorthodox '' ? On the face of it , it is because he employs deductive techniques alien to official police routine . Another , more interesting explanation , is hinted at by Watson when he observes on several occasions that Holmes would have made a magnificent criminal . The great detective modestly agrees . Watson's insight is verified by the mysterious link between Holmes and his arch-opponent , Dr. Moriarty . The two men resemble each other closely in their cunning , their egotism , their relentlessness . The first series of Sherlock Holmes adventures ends with Holmes and Moriarty grappling together on the edge of a cliff . They are presumed to have plunged to a common grave in this fatal embrace . Linked to Holmes even in death , Moriarty represents the alter-ego of the great detective , the image of what our hero might have become were he not a public servant . Just as Holmes the eccentric stands behind Holmes the detective , so Holmes the potential criminal lurks behind both . In the modern English `` whodunnit '' , this insinuation of latent criminality in the detective himself has almost entirely disappeared . Hercule Poirot and Lord Peter Whimsey ( the respective creations of Agatha Christie and Dorothy Sayers ) have retained Holmes' egotism but not his zest for life and eccentric habits . Poirot and his counterparts are perfectly respectable people ; ; it is true that they are also extremely dull . Their dedication to the status quo has been affirmed at the expense of the fascinating but dangerous individualism of a Sherlock Holmes . The latter's real descendents were unable to take root in England ; ; they fled from the Victorian parlor and made their way across the stormy Atlantic . In the American `` hardboiled '' detective story of the '20s and '30s , the spirit of the mad genius from Baker Street lives on . Like Holmes , the American private eye rejects the social conventions of his time . But unlike Holmes , he feels his society to be not merely dull but also corrupt . Surrounded by crime and violence everywhere , the `` hardboiled '' private eye can retain his purity only through a life of self-imposed isolation . His alienation is far more acute than Holmes' ; ; he is not an eccentric but rather an outcast . With Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe , alienation is represented on a purely physical plane . Wolfe refuses to ever leave his own house , and spends most of his time drinking beer and playing with orchids . More profound and more disturbing , however , is the moral isolation of Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe . In a society where everything is for sale , Marlowe is the only man who cannot be bought . His tough honesty condemns him to a solitary and difficult existence . Beaten , bruised and exhausted , he pursues the elusive killer through the demi-monde of high society and low morals , always alone , always despised . In the end , he gets his man , but no one seems to care ; ; virtue is its own and only reward . A similar tone of underlying futility and despair pervades the spy thrillers of Eric Ambler and dominates the most famous of all American mystery stories , Dashiell Hammett's The Maltese Falcon . Sam Spade joins forces with a band of adventurers in search of a priceless jeweled statue of a falcon ; ; but when the bird is found at last , it turns out to be a fake . Now the detective must save his own skin by informing on the girl he loves , who is also the real murderer . For Sam Spade , neither crime nor virtue pays ; ; moreover , it is increasingly difficult to distinguish between the two . Because the private eye intends to save society in spite of himself , he invariably finds himself in trouble with the police . The latter are either too stupid to catch the killer or too corrupt to care . In either case , they do not appreciate the private detective's zeal . Perry Mason and Hamilton Burger , Nero Wolfe and Inspector Cramer spend more time fighting each other than they do in looking for the criminal . Frequently enough , the police are themselves in league with the killer ; ; Dashiell Hammett's Red Harvest provides a classic example of this theme . But even when the police are honest , they do not trust the private eye . He is , like Phillip Marlowe , too alienated to be reliable . Finally , in The Maltese Falcon among others , the clash between detective and police is carried to its logical conclusion : Sam Spade becomes the chief murder suspect . In order to exonerate himself , he is compelled to find the real criminal , who happens to be his girl friend . What was only a vague suspicion in the case of Sherlock Holmes now appears as a direct accusation : the private eye is in danger of turning into his opposite . It is the growing contradiction between individualism and public service in the mystery story which creates this fatal dilemma . By upholding his own personal code of behavior , the private detective has placed himself in opposition to a society whose fabric is permeated with crime and corruption . That society responds by condemning the private eye as a threat to the status quo , a potential criminal . If the detective insists upon retaining his personal standards , he must now do so in conscious defiance of his society . He must , in short , cease to be a detective and become a rebel . On the other hand , if he wishes to continue in his chosen profession , he must abandon his own code and sacrifice his precious individualism . Dashiell Hammett resolved this contradiction by ceasing to write mystery stories and turning to other pursuits . His successors have adopted the opposite alternative . In order to save the mystery story , they have converted the private detective into an organization man . The first of two possible variations on this theme is symbolized by Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer . At first glance , this hero seems to be more rather than less of an individualist than any of his predecessors . For Hammer , nothing is forbidden . He kills when he pleases , takes his women where he finds them and always acts as judge , jury and executioner rolled into one . It will be shown that the objectives of the cooperative people in an organization determine the type of network required , because the type of network functions according to the characteristics of the messages enumerated in Table 1 . Great stress is placed on the role that the monitoring of information sending plays in maintaining the effectiveness of the network . By monitoring , we mean some system of control over the types of information sent from the various centers . As a word of caution , we should be aware that in actual practice no message is purely one of the four types , question , command , statement , or exclamation . For example , suppose a man wearing a $200 watch , driving a 1959 Rolls Royce , stops to ask a man on the sidewalk , `` What time is it '' ? This sentence would have most of the characteristics of a question , but it has some of the characteristics of a statement because the questioner has conveyed the fact that he has no faith in his own timepiece or the one attached to his car . If the man on the sidewalk is surprised at this question , it has served as an exclamation . Also , since the man questioned feels a strong compulsion to answer ( and thereby avoid the consequences of being thought queer ) the question has assumed some measurable properties of a command . However , for convenience we will stick to the idea that information can be classified according to Table 1 . On this basis , certain extreme kinds of networks will be discussed for illustrative purposes . Networks illustrating some special types of organization the cocktail party . Presumably a cocktail party is expected to fulfill the host's desire to get together a number of people who are inadequately acquainted and thereby arrange for bringing the level of acquaintance up to adequacy for future cooperative endeavors . The party is usually in a room small enough so that all guests are within sight and hearing of one another . The information is furnished by each of the guests , is sent by oral broadcasting over the air waves , and is received by the ears . Since the air is a continuum , the network of communication remains intact regardless of the positions or motions of the points ( the people ) in the net . As shown in Figure 1 , there is a connection for communication between every pair of points . This , and other qualifications , make the cocktail party the most complete and most chaotic communication system ever dreamed up . All four types of message listed in Table 1 are permitted , although decorum and cocktail tradition require holding the commands to a minimum , while exclamations having complimentary intonations are more than customarily encouraged . The completeness of the connections provide that , for N people , there are Af lines of communication between the pairs , which can become a large number ( 1,225 ) for a party of fifty guests . Looking at the diagram , we see that Af connection lines come in to each member . Thus the cocktail party would appear to be the ideal system , but there is one weakness . In spite of the dreams of the host for oneness in the group , the Af incoming messages for each guest overload his receiving system beyond comprehension if N exceeds about six . The crowd consequently breaks up into temporary groups ranging in size from two to six , with a half-life for the cluster ranging from three to twenty minutes . For the occasion on which everyone already knows everyone else and the host wishes them to meet one or a few honored newcomers , then the `` open house '' system is advantageous because the honored guests are fixed connective points and the drifting guests make and break connections at the door . The rural community . We consider a rural community as an assemblage of inhabited dwellings whose configuration is determined by the location and size of the arable land sites necessary for family subsistence . We assume for this illustration that the size of the land plots is so great that the distance between dwellings is greater than the voice can carry and that most of the communication is between nearest neighbors only , as shown in Figure 2 . Information beyond nearest neighbor is carried second- , third- , and fourth-hand as a distortable rumor . In Figure 2 , the points in the network are designated by a letter accompanied by a number . The numbers indicate the number of nearest neighbors . It will be noted that point f has seven nearest neighbors , h and e have six , and p has only one , while the remaining points have intermediate numbers . In any social system in which communications have an importance comparable with that of production and other human factors , a point like f in Figure 2 would ( other things being equal ) be the dwelling place for the community leader , while e and h would house the next most important citizens . A point like p gets information directly from n , but all information beyond n is indirectly relayed through n . The dweller at p is last to hear about a new cure , the slowest to announce to his neighbors his urgent distresses , the one who goes the farthest to trade , and the one with the greatest difficulty of all in putting over an idea or getting people to join him in a cooperative effort . Since the hazards of poor communication are so great , p can be justified as a habitable site only on the basis of unusual productivity such as is made available by a waterfall for milling purposes , a mine , or a sugar maple camp . Location theorists have given these matters much consideration . Military organizations . The networks for military communications are one of the best examples of networks which not only must be changed with the changes in objectives but also must be changed with the addition of new machines of war . They also furnish proof that , in modern war , message sending must be monitored . Without monitoring , a military hookup becomes a noisy party . The need for monitoring became greater when radio was adopted for military signaling . Alexander the Great , who used runners as message carriers , did not have to worry about having every officer in his command hear what he said and having hundreds of them comment at once . As time has passed and science has progressed , the speed of military vehicles has increased , the range of missiles has been extended , the use of target-hunting noses on the projectiles has been adopted , and the range and breadth of message sending has increased . Next to the old problem of the slowness of decision making , network structure seems to be paramount , and without monitoring no network has value . On the parade ground the net may be similar to that shown in Figure 3 . The monitoring is the highest and most restrictive of any organization in existence . No questions , statements , or explanations are permitted -- only commands . Commands go only from an officer to the man of nearest lower rank . The same command is repeated as many times as there are levels in rank from general to corporal . All orders originate with the officer of highest rank and terminate with action of the men in the ranks . Even the officer in charge , be it a captain ( for small display ) or a general , is restrained by monitoring . This is done for simplicity of commands and to bring the hidden redundancy up to where misunderstanding has almost zero possibility . The commands are specified by the military regulations ; ; are few in number , briefly worded , all different in sound ; ; and are combinable into sequences which permit any marching maneuver that could be desired on a parade ground . This monitoring is necessary because , on a parade ground , everyone can hear too much , and without monitoring a confused social event would develop . With troops dispersed on fields of battle rather than on the parade ground , it may seem that a certain amount of monitoring is automatically enforced by the lines of communication . Years ago this was true , but with the replacement of wires or runners by radio and radar ( and perhaps television ) , these restrictions have disappeared and now again too much is heard . In contrast to cocktail parties , military organizations , even in the field , are more formal . In the extreme and oversimplified example suggested in Figure 3 , the organization is more easily understood and more predictable in behavior . A military organization has an objective chosen by the higher command . This objective is adhered to throughout the duration of the action . The connective system , or network , is tailored to meet the requirements of the objective , and it is therefore not surprising that a military body acting as a single coordinated unit has a different communication network than a factory , a college , or a rural village . The assumptions upon which the example shown in Figure 3 is based are : ( A ) One man can direct about six subordinates if the subordinates are chosen carefully so that they do not need too much personal coaching , indoctrinating , etc. . ( B ) A message runs too great a risk of being distorted if it is to be relayed more than about six consecutive times . ( C ) Decisions of a general kind are made by the central command . And ( D ) all action of a physical kind pertinent to the mission is relegated to the line of men on the lower rank . These assumptions lead to an organization with one man at the top , six directly under him , six under each of these , and so on until there are six levels of personnel . The number of people acting as one body by this scheme gives a surprisingly large army of 55,987 men . This organizational network would be of no avail if there were no regulations pertaining to the types of message sent . Of types of message listed in Table 1 , commands and statements are the only ones sent through the vertical network shown in Figure 3 . A further regulation is that commands always go down , unaccompanied by statements , and statements always go up , unaccompanied by commands . Questions and , particularly , exclamations are usually channeled along informal , horizontal lines not indicated in Figure 3 and seldom are carried beyond the nearest neighbor . It will readily be seen that in this suggested network ( not materially different from some of the networks in vogue today ) greater emphasis on monitoring is implied than is usually put into practice . Furthermore , the network in Figure 3 is only the basic net through which other networks pertaining to logistics and the like are interlaced . Not discussed here are some military problems of modern times such as undersea warfare , where the surveillance , sending , transmitting , and receiving are all so inadequate that networks and decision making are not the bottlenecks . Such problems are of extreme interest as well as importance and are so much like fighting in a rain forest or guerrilla warfare at night in tall grass that we might have to re-examine primitive conflicts for what they could teach . A team for useful research . This is an unsolved problem which probably has never been seriously investigated , although one frequently hears the comment that we have insufficient specialists of the kind who can compete with the Germans or Swiss , for example , in precision machinery and mathematics , or the Finns in geochemistry . We hear equally fervent concern over the belief that we have not enough generalists who can see the over-all picture and combine our national skills and knowledge for useful purposes . This problem of the optimum balance in the relative numbers of generalists and specialists can be investigated on a communicative network basis . Since the difficulty of drawing the net is great , we will merely discuss it . First , we realize that a pure specialist does not exist . But , for practical purposes , we have people who can be considered as such . For example , there are persons who are in physical science , in the field of mineralogy , trained in crystallography , who use only X-rays , applying only the powder technique of X-ray diffraction , to clay minerals only , and who have spent the last fifteen years concentrating on the montmorillonites ; ; or persons in the social sciences in the field of anthropology , studying the lung capacity of seven Andean Indians . So we see that a specialist is a man who knows more and more about less and less as he develops , as contrasted to the generalist , who knows less and less about more and more . American democratic thought , pointed up the relation between the Protestant movement in this country and the development of a social religion , which he called the American Democratic Faith . Those familiar with his work will remember that he placed the incipience of the democratic faith at around 1850 . And he describes it as a balanced polarity between the notions of the free individual and what he called the fundamental law . I want to say more about Gabriel's so-called fundamental law . But first I want to quote him on the relationship that he found between religion and politics in this country and what happened to it . He points out that from the time of Jackson on through World War 1 , , evangelical Protestantism was a dominant influence in the social and political life of America . He terms this early enthusiasm `` Romantic Christianity '' and concludes that its similarity to democratic beliefs of that day is so great that `` the doctrine of liberty seems but a secular version of its counterpart in evangelical Protestantism '' . Let me quote him even more fully , for his analysis is important to my theme . He says : `` beside the Protestant philosophy of Progress , as expressed in radical or conservative millenarianism , should be placed the doctrine of the democratic faith which affirmed it to be the duty of the destiny of the United States to assist in the creation of a better world by keeping lighted the beacon of democracy '' . He specifies , `` in the middle period of the Nineteenth Century it was colored by Christian supernaturalism , in the Twentieth Century it was affected by naturalism . But in every period it has been humanism '' . And let me add , utopianism , also . Some fourteen or fifteen years ago , in an essay I called The Leader Follows -- Where ? I used his polarity to illustrate what I thought had happened to us in that form of liberalism we call Progressivism . It seemed to me that the liberals had scrapped the balanced polarity and reposed both liberty and the fundamental law in the common man . That is to say Gabriel's fundamental law had been so much modified by this time that it was neither fundamental nor law any more . It is a weakness of Gabriel's analysis that he never seems to realize that his so-called fundamental law had already been cut loose from its foundations when it was adapted to democracy . And with Progressivism the Religion of Humanity was replacing what Gabriel called Christian supernaturalism . And the common man was developing mythic power , or charisma , on his own . During the decade that followed , the common man , as that piece put it , grew uncomfortable as the Voice of God and fled from behind Saint Woodrow ( Wilson ) only to learn from Science , to his shocked relief that after all there was no God he had to speak for and that he was just an animal anyhow -- that there was a chemical formula for him , and that too much couldn't be expected of him . The socialism implicit in the slogan of the Roosevelt Revolution , freedom from want and fear , seems a far cry from the individualism of the First Amendment to the Constitution , or of the Jacksonian frontier . What had happened to the common man ? French Egalitarianism had had only nominal influence in this country before the days of Popularism . The riotous onrush of industrialism after the War for Southern Independence and the general secular drift to the Religion of Humanity , however , prepared the way for a reception of the French Revolution's socialistic offspring of one sort of another . The first of which to find important place in our federal government was the graduated income tax under Wilson . Moreover the centralization of our economy during the 1920s , the dislocations of the Depression , the common ethos of Materialism everywhere , all contributed in various ways to the face-lifting that replaced Mike Fink and the Great Gatsby with the anonymous physiognomy of the Little People . However , it is important to trace the philosophy of the French Revolution to its sources to understand the common democratic origin of individualism and socialism and the influence of the latter on the former . That John Locke's philosophy of the social contract fathered the American Revolution with its Declaration of Independence , I believe , we generally accept . Yet , after Rousseau had given the social contract a new twist with his notion of the General Will , the same philosophy , it may be said , became the idea source of the French Revolution also . The importance of Rousseau's twist has not always been clear to us , however . This notion of the General Will gave rise to the Commune of Paris in the Revolution and later brought Napoleon to dictatorship . And it is clearly argued by Lord Percy of Newcastle , in his remarkable long essay , The Heresy Of Democracy , and in a more general way by Voegelin , in his New Science Of Politics , that this same Rousseauan idea , descending through European democracy , is the source of Marx's theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat . This is important to understanding the position that doctrinaire liberals found themselves in after World War 2 , and our great democratic victory that brought no peace . The long road that had taken liberals in this country into the social religion of democracy , into a worship of man , led logically to the Marxist dream of a classless society under a Socialist State . And the ussr existed as the revolutionary experiment in radical socialism , the ultimate exemplar . And by the time the war ended , liberal leadership in this country was spiritually Marxist . We will recall that the still confident liberals of the Truman administration gathered with other Western utopians in San Francisco to set up the legal framework , finally and at last , to rationalize war -- to rationalize want and fear -- out of the world : the United Nations . We of the liberal-led world got all set for peace and rehabilitation . Then suddenly we found ourselves in the middle of another fight , an irrational , an indecent , an undeclared and immoral war with our strongest ( and some had thought noblest ) ally . During the next five years the leaders of the Fair Deal reluctantly backed down from the optimistic expectations of the New Deal . During the next five years liberal leaders in the United States sank in the cumulative confusion attendant upon and manifested in a negative policy of Containment -- and the bitterest irony -- enforced and enforceable only by threat of a weapon that we felt the greatest distaste for but could not abandon : the atom bomb . In 1952 , it will be remembered , the G.O.P. without positive program campaigned on the popular disillusionment with liberal leadership and won overwhelmingly . All of this , I know , is recent history familiar to you . But I have been at some pains to review it as the drama of the common man , to point up what happened to him under Eisenhower's leadership . A perceptive journalist , Sam Lubell , has phrased it in the title of one of his books as the revolt of the moderates . He opens his discourse , however , with a review of the Eisenhower inaugural festivities at which a sympathetic press had assembled its massive talents , all primed to catch some revelation of the emerging new age . The show was colorful , indeed , exuberant , but the press for all its assiduity could detect no note of a fateful rendezvous with destiny . Lubell offers his book as an explanation of why there was no clue . And I select this sentence as its pertinent summation : `` in essence the drama of his ( Eisenhower's ) Presidency can be described as the ordeal of a nation turned conservative and struggling -- thus far with but limited and precarious success -- to give effective voice and force to that conservatism '' . I will assume that we are all aware of the continuing struggle , with its limited and precarious success , toward conservatism . It has moved on various levels , it has been clamorous and confused . Obviously there has been no agreement on what American conservatism is , or rather , what it should be . For it was neglected , not to say nascent , when the struggle began . I saw a piece the other day assailing William Buckley , author of Man And God at Yale and publisher of The National Review , as no conservative at all , but an old liberal . I would agree with this view . But I'm not here to define conservatism . What I am here to do is to report on the gyrations of the struggle -- a struggle that amounts to self-redefinition -- to see if we can predict its future course . One of the obvious conclusions we can make on the basis of the last election , I suppose , is that we , the majority , were dissatisfied with Eisenhower conservatism . Though , to be sure , we gave Kennedy no very positive approval in the margin of his preferment . This is , however , symptomatic of our national malaise . But before I try to diagnose it , I would offer other evidence . I will mention two volumes of specific comment on this malaise that appeared last year . The earlier of them was an unofficial enterprise , sponsored by Life magazine , under the title of The National Purpose . The contributors to this testament were all well-known : a former Democratic candidate for President , a New Deal poet , the magazine's chief editorial writer , two newspaper columnists , head of a national broadcasting company , a popular Protestant evangelist , etc. . What I want to point out here is that all of them are ex-liberals , or modified liberals , with perhaps one exception . I suppose we might classify Billy Graham as an old liberal . And I would further note that they all -- with one exception again -- sang in one key or another the same song . Its refrain was : `` let us return to the individualistic democracy of our forefathers for our salvation '' . Adlai Stevenson expressed some reservations about this return . Others invoked technology and common sense . Only Walter Lippman envisioned the possibility of our having `` outlived most of what we used to regard as the program of our national purposes '' . But the most notable thing about the incantation of these ex-liberals was that the one-time shibboleth of socialism was conspicuously absent . The second specific comment was the report of Eisenhower's Commission on National Goals , titled Goals For Americans . They , perhaps , gave the pitch of their position in the preface where it was said that Eisenhower requested that the Commission be administered by the American Assembly of Columbia University , because it was non-partisan . The Commission seems to represent the viewpoint of what I would call the unconscious liberal , but not unconscious enough , to invoke the now taboo symbolism of socialism . And here again we hear the same refrain mentioned above : `` the paramount goal of the United States set long ago was to guard the rights of the individual , ensure his development , enlarge his opportunity '' . This group is secularist and their program tends to be technological . But it is the need to undertake these testaments that I would submit here as symptom of the common man's malaise . And let me add Murray's new book as another symptom of it , particularly so in view of the attention Time magazine gave it when it came out recently . Father Murray goes back to the Declaration of Independence , too , though I may add , with considerably more historical perception . I will reserve discussion of it for a moment , however , to return to President Kennedy . As symptomatic of the common man's malaise , he is most significant : a liberal and a Catholic , elected by the skin of his teeth . Does that not suggest to you an uncertain and uneasy , not to say confused , state of the public mind ? What is the common man's complaint ? Let's take a panoramic look back over the course we have come . Has not that way been lit always by the lamp of liberalism up until the turning back under Eisenhower ? And the basic character of that liberalism has been spiritual rather than economic . Ralph Gabriel gave it the name of Protestant philosophy of Progress . But there's a subjective side to that utopian outlook . Does our society have a runaway , uncontrollable growth of technology which may end our civilization , or a normal , healthy growth ? Here there may be an analogy with cancer : we can detect cancers by their rapidly accelerating growth , determinable only when related to the more normal rate of healthy growth . Should the accelerating growth of technology then warn us ? Noting such evidence is the first step ; ; and almost the only `` cure '' is early detection and removal . One way to determine whether we have so dangerous a technology would be to check the strength of our society's organs to see if their functioning is as healthy as before . So an objective look at our present procedures may move us to consider seriously this possibly analogous situation . In any event , whether society may have cancer , or merely a virus infection , the `` disease '' , we shall find , is political , economical , social , and even medical . Have not our physical abilities already deteriorated because of the more sedentary lives we are now living ? Hence the prime issue , as I see it , is whether a democratic or free society can master technology for the benefit of mankind , or whether technology will rule and develop its own society compatible with its own needs as a force of nature . We are already committed to establishing man's supremacy over nature and everywhere on earth , not merely in the limited social-political-economical context we are fond of today . Otherwise , we go on endlessly trying to draw the line , color and other , as to which kind of man we wish to see dominate . We have proved so able to solve technological problems that to contend we cannot realize a universal goal in the immediate future is to be extremely shortsighted , if nothing else . We must believe we have the ability to affect our own destinies : otherwise why try anything ? So in these pages the term `` technology '' is used to include any and all means which could amplify , project , or augment man's control over himself and over other men . Naturally this includes all communication forms , e.g. languages , or any social , political , economic or religious structures employed for such control . Properly mindful of all the cultures in existence today throughout the world , we must employ these resources without war or violent revolution . If we were creating a wholly new society , we could insist that our social , political , economic and philosophic institutions foster rather than hamper man ; ; best growth . But we cannot start off with a clean slate . So we must first analyze our present institutions with respect to the effect of each on man's major needs . Asked which institution most needs correction , I would say the corporation as it exists in America today . At first glance this appears strange : of all people , was not America founded by rugged individualists who established a new way of life still inspiring `` undeveloped '' societies abroad ? But hear Harrison E. Salisbury , former Moscow correspondent of The New York Times , and author of `` To Moscow -- And Beyond '' . In a book review of `` The Soviet Cultural Offensive '' , he says , `` Long before the State Department organized its bureaucracy into an East-West Contacts Staff in order to wage a cultural counter-offensive within Soviet borders , the sharp cutting-edge of American culture had carved its mark across the Russian steppes , as when the enterprising promoters of ' Porgy And Bess ' overrode the State Department to carry the contemporary ' cultural warfare ' behind the enemy lines . They were not diplomats or jazz musicians , or even organizers of reading-rooms and photo-montage displays , but rugged capitalist entrepreneurs like Henry Ford , Hugh Cooper , Thomas Campbell , the International Harvester Co. , and David W. Griffith . Their kind created an American culture superior to any in the world , an industrial and technological culture which penetrated Russia as it did almost every corner of the earth without a nickel from the Federal treasury or a single governmental specialist to contrive directives or program a series of consultations of interested agencies . This favorable image of America in the minds of Russian men and women is still there despite years of energetic anti-American propaganda '' corporations now outmoded . Perhaps the public's present attitude toward business stems from the fact that the `` rugged capitalist entrepreneur '' no more exists in America . In his stead is a milquetoast version known as `` the corporation '' . But even if we cannot see the repulsive characteristics in this new image of America , foreigners can ; ; and our loss of `` prestige '' abroad is the direct result . No amount of ballyhoo will cover up the sordid facts . If we want respect from ourselves or others , we will have to earn it . First , let us realize that whatever good this set-up achieved in earlier times , now the corporation per se cannot take economic leadership . Businesses must develop as a result of the ideas , energies and ambitions of an individual having purpose and comprehensive ability within one mind . When we `` forced '' individuals to assume the corporate structure by means of taxes and other legal statutes , we adopted what I would term `` pseudo-capitalism '' and so took a major step toward socialism . The biggest loss , of course , was the individual's lessened desire and ability to give his services to the growth of his company and our economy . Socialism , I grant , has a definite place in our society . But let us not complain of the evils of capitalism by referring to a form that is not truly capitalistic . Some forms of capitalism do indeed work -- superb organizations , a credit to any society . But the pseudo-capitalism which dictates our whole economy as well as our politics and social life , will not stand close scrutiny . Its pretense to operate in the public interest is little more than a sham . It serves only its own stockholders and poorly at that . As a creative enterprise , its abilities are primarily in `` swallowing '' creative enterprises developed outside its own organization ( an ability made possible by us , and almost mandatory ) . As to benefits to employees , it is notorious for its callous disregard except where it depends on them for services . The corporation in America is in reality our form of socialism , vying in a sense with the other socialistic form that has emerged within governmental bureaucracy . But while the corporation has all the disadvantages of the socialist form of organization ( so cumbersome it cannot constructively do much of anything not compatible with its need to perpetuate itself and maintain its status quo ) , unluckily it does not have the desirable aspect of socialism , the motivation to operate for the benefit of society as a whole . So we are faced with a vast network of amorphous entities perpetuating themselves in whatever manner they can , without regard to the needs of society , controlling society and forcing upon it a regime representing only the corporation's needs for survival . The corporation has a limited , specific place in our society . Ideally speaking , it should be allowed to operate only where the public has a great stake in the continuity of supply or services , and where the actions of a single proprietor are secondary to the needs of society . Examples are in public utilities , making military aircraft and accessories , or where the investment and risk for a proprietorship would be too great for a much needed project impossible to achieve by any means other than the corporate form , e.g. constructing major airports or dams . Thus , if corporations are not to run away with us , they must become quasi-governmental institutions , subject to public control and needs . In all other areas , private initiative of the `` proprietorship '' type should be urged to produce the desired goods and services . Proprietorship Avoiding runaway technology can be done only by assuring a humane society ; ; and for this human beings must be firmly in control of the economics on which our society rests . Such genuine human leadership the proprietorship can offer , corporations cannot . It can project long-range goals for itself . Corporations react violently to short-range stimuli , e.g. , quarterly and annual dividend reports . Proprietorships can establish a unity and integrity of control ; ; corporations , being more amorphous , cannot . Proprietorships can establish a meaningful identity , representing a human personality , and thus establish sincere relationships with customers and community . Corporations are apt by nature to be impersonal , inhumane , shortsighted and almost exclusively profit-motivated , a picture they could scarcely afford to present to the public . The proprietor is able to create a leadership impossible in the corporate structure with its board of directors and stockholders . Leadership is lacking in our society because it has no legitimate place to develop . Men continuously at the head of growing enterprises can acquire experiences of the most varied , complicated and trying type so that at maturation they have developed the competence and willingness to accept the personal responsibility so sorely needed now . Hence government must establish greater controls upon corporations so that their activities promote what is deemed essential to the national interest . Proprietorships should get the tax advantages now accruing to corporations , e.g. the chance to accumulate capital so vital for growth . Corporations should pay added taxes , to be used for educational purposes ( not necessarily of the formal type ) . The right to leave legacies should be substantially reduced and ultimately eliminated . To perpetuate wealth control led by small groups of individuals who played no role in its creation prevents those with real initiative from coming to the fore , and is basically anti-democratic . When the proprietor dies , the establishment should become a corporation until it is either acquired by another proprietor or the government decides to drop it . Strikes should be declared illegal against corporations because disagreements would have to be settled by government representatives acting as controllers of the corporation whose responsibility to the state would now be defined against proprietorship because employees and proprietors must be completely interdependent , as they are each a part of the whole . Strikes threatening the security of the proprietorship , if internally motivated , prevent a healthy relationship . Certainly external forces should not be applied arbitrarily out of mere power available to do so . If we cannot stop warfare in our own economic system , how can we expect to abolish it internationally ? One kind of proprietorship These proposals would go far toward creating the economic atmosphere favoring growth of the individual , who , in turn , would help us to cope with runaway technology . Individual human strength is needed to pit against an inhuman condition . The battle is not easy . We are tempted to blame others for our problems rather than look them straight in the face and realize they are of our own making and possible of solution only by ourselves with the help of desperately needed , enlightened , competent leaders . Persons developed in today's corporations cannot hope to serve here -- a judgment based on experiences of my own in business and in activities outside . In my own company , in effect a partnership , although legally a corporation , I have been able to do many things for my employees which `` normal '' corporations of comparable size and nature would have been unable to do . Also , I am convinced that if my company were a sole proprietorship instead of a partnership , I would have been even abler to solve long-range problems for myself and my fellow-employees . Any abilities I may have were achieved in their present shape from experience in sharing in the growth and control of my business , coupled with raising my family . This combined experience , on a foundation of very average , I assure you , intelligence and background , has helped me do things many well-informed people would bet heavily against . Perhaps a list of some of the `` practices '' of my company will help here . The company grew out of efforts by two completely inexperienced men in their late twenties , neither having a formal education applicable to , or experience in , manufacturing or selling our type of articles . From an initial investment of $1,200 in 1943 , it has grown , with no additional capital investment , to a present value estimated by some as exceeding $10,000,000 ( we don't disclose financial figures to the public ) . Its growth continues steadily on a par with past growth ; ; and no limitation is in evidence . Our pin-curl clips and self-locking nuts achieved dominance in just a few years time , despite substantial , well established competition . During the last years of Woodrow Wilson's administration , a red scare developed in our country . Many Americans reacted irrationally to the challenge of Russia and turned to the repression of ideas by force . Postmaster General Burleson set about to protect the American people against radical propaganda that might be spread through the mails . Attorney General Palmer made a series of raids that sent more than 4,000 so-called radicals to the jails , in direct violation of their constitutional rights . Then , not many years later , the Un-American Activities Committee , under the leadership of Martin Dies , pilloried hundreds of decent , patriotic citizens . Anyone who tried to remedy some of the most glaring defects in our form of democracy was denounced as a traitorous red whose real purpose was the destruction of our government . This hysteria reached its height under the leadership of Senator Joseph McCarthy . Demagogues of this sort found communist bogeys lurking behind any new idea that would run counter to stereotyped notions . New ideas were dangerous and must be repressed , no matter how . Those who would suppress dangerous thoughts , credit ideas with high potency . They give strict interpretation to William James' statement that `` Every idea that enters the mind tends to express itself '' . They seem to believe that a person will act automatically as soon as he contacts something new . Hence , the only defensible procedure is to repress any and every notion , unless it gives evidence that it is perfectly safe . Despite this danger , however , we are informed on every hand that ideas , not machines , are our finest tools ; ; they are priceless even though they cannot be recorded on a ledger page ; ; they are the most valuable of commodities -- and the most salable , for their demand far exceeds supply . So all-important are ideas , we are told , that persons successful in business and happy in social life usually fall into two classes : those who invent new ideas of their own , and those who borrow , beg , or steal from others . Seemingly , with an unrestricted flow of ideas , all will be well , and we are even assured that `` an idea a day will keep the sheriff away '' . That , however , may also bring the police , if the thinking does not meet with social approval . Criminals , as well as model citizens , exercise their minds . Merely having a mental image of some sort is not the all-important consideration . Of course , there must be clarity : a single distinct impression is more valuable than many fuzzy ones . But clarity is not enough . The writer took a class of college students to the state hospital for the mentally ill in St. Joseph , Missouri . An inmate , a former university professor , expounded to us , logically and clearly , that someone was pilfering his thoughts . He appealed to us to bring his case to the attention of the authorities that justice might be done . Despite the clarity of his presentation , his idea was not of Einsteinian calibre . True , ideas are important , perhaps life's most precious treasures . But have we not gone overboard in stressing their significance ? Have we not actually developed idea worship ? Ideas we must have , and we seek them everywhere . We scour literature for them ; ; here we find stored the wisdom of great minds . But are all these works worthy of consideration ? Can they stand rigid scrutiny ? Shakespeare's wit and wisdom , his profound insight into human nature , have stood the test of centuries . But was he infallible in all things ? What of his treatment of the Jew in The Merchant Of Venice ? Shakespeare gives us a vivid picture of Shylock , but probably he never saw a Jew , unless in some of his travels . The Jews had been banished from England in 1290 and were not permitted to return before 1655 , when Shakespeare had been dead for thirty-nine years . If any had escaped expulsion by hiding , they certainly would not frequent the market-place . Shakespeare did not usually invent the incidents in his plays , but borrowed them from old stories , ballads , and plays , wove them together , and then breathed into them his spark of life . Rather than from a first-hand study of Jewish people , his delineation of Shylock stems from a collection of Italian stories , Il Pecorone , published in 1558 , although written almost two centuries earlier . He could learn at second hand from books , but could not thus capture the real Jewish spirit . Harris J. Griston , in Shaking The Dust From Shakespeare ( 216 ) , writes : `` There is not a word spoken by Shylock which one would expect from a real Jew '' . He took the story of the pound of flesh and had to fasten it on someone . The Jew was the safest victim . No Jew was on hand to boycott his financially struggling theater . It would have been unwise policy , for instance , to apply the pound-of-flesh characterization to the thrifty Scotchman . Just as now anyone may hurl insults at a citizen of Mars , or even of Tikopia , and no senatorial investigation will result . Who cares about them ! Shakespeare does not tell us that Shylock was an aberrant individual . He sets him forth as being typical of the group . He tells of his `` Jewish heart '' -- not a Shylockian heart ; ; but a Jewish heart . This would make anyone crafty and cruel , capable of fiendish revenge . There is no justification for such misrepresentation . If living Jews were unavailable for study , the Bible was at hand . Reading the Old Testament would have shown the dramatist that the ideas attributed to Shylock were abhorrent to the Jews . Are we better off for having Shakespeare's idea of Shylock ? Studying The Merchant Of Venice in high school and college has given many young people their notions about Jews . Does this help the non-Jew to understand this group ? Thomas De Torquemada , Inquisitor-General of the Spanish Inquisition , put many persons to death . His name became synonymous with cold-blooded cruelty . Would we gain by keeping alive his memory and besmirching today's Roman Catholics by saying he had a Catholic heart ? Let his bones and his memory rest in the fifteenth century where they belong ; ; he is out of place in our times . Shakespeare's Shylock , too , is of dubious value in the modern world . Ideas , in and of themselves , are not necessarily the greatest good . A successful businessman recently prefaced his address to a luncheon group with the statement that all economists should be sent to the hospitals for the mentally deranged where they and their theories might rot together . Will his words come to be treasured and quoted through the years ? Frequently we are given assurance that automatically all ideas will be sifted and resifted and in the end only the good ones will survive . But is that not like going to a chemistry laboratory and blindly pouring out liquids and powders from an array of bottles and then , after stirring , expecting a new wonder drug inevitably to result ? What of the efficiency of this natural instrument of free discussion ? Is there some magic in it that assures results ? When Peter B. Kyne ( Pride Of Palomar , 43 ) informed us in 1921 that we had an instinctive dislike for the Japanese , did the heated debates of the Californians settle the truth or falsity of the proposition ? The Leopard's Spots came from the pen of Thomas Dixon in 1902 , and in this he announced an `` unchangeable '' law . If a child had a single drop of Negro blood , he would revert to the ancestral line which , except as slaves under a superior race , had not made one step of progress in 3,000 years . That doctrine has been accepted by many , but has it produced good results ? In the same vein , a certain short-story plot has been overworked . The son and heir of a prominent family marries a girl who has tell-tale shadows on the half-moons of her finger nails . In time she presents her aristocratic husband with a coal-black child . Is the world better for having this idea thrust upon it ? Will argument and debate decide its truth or falsity ? For answers to such questions we must turn to the anthropologists , the biologists , the historians , the psychologists , and the sociologists . Long ago they consigned the notions of Kyne and Dixon to the scrap heap . False ideas surfeit another sector of our life . For several generations much fiction has appeared dealing with the steprelationship . The stepmother , almost without exception , has been presented as a cruel ogress . Children , conditioned by this mistaken notion , have feared stepmothers , while adults , by their antagonistic attitudes , have made the role of the substitute parents a difficult one . Debate is not likely to resolve the tensions and make the lot of the stepchild a happier one . Research , on the other hand , has shown many stepmothers to be eminently successful , some far better than the real mothers . Helen Deutsch informed us ( The Psychology Of Women , Vol. 2 , , 434 ) that in all cultures `` the term ' stepmother ' automatically evokes deprecatory implications '' , a conclusion accepted by many . Will mere debate on that proposition , even though it be free and untrammeled , remove the dross and leave a residue of refined gold ? That is questionable , to say the least . Research into several cultures has proven her position to be a mistaken one . Most assuredly ideas are invaluable . But ideas , just for the sake of having them , are not enough . In the 1930's , cures for the depression literally flooded Washington . For a time the President received hundreds of them every day , most of them worthless . Ideas need to be tested , and not merely by argument and debate . When some question arises in the medical field concerning cancer , for instance , we do not turn to free and open discussion as in a political campaign . We have recourse to the scientifically-trained specialist in the laboratory . The merits of the Salk anti-polio vaccine were not established on the forensic platform or in newspaper editorials , but in the laboratory and by tests in the field on thousands of children . Our presidential campaigns provide much debate and argument . But is the result new barnsful of tested knowledge on the basis of which we can with confidence solve our domestic and international problems ? Man , we are told , is endowed with reason and is capable of distinguishing good from bad . But what a super-Herculean task it is to winnow anything of value from the mud-beplastered arguments used so freely , particularly since such common use is made of cliches and stereotypes , in themselves declarations of intellectual bankruptcy . We are reminded , however , that freedom of thought and discussion , the unfettered exchange of ideas , is basic under our form of government . Assuredly in our political campaigns there is freedom to think , to examine any and all issues , and to speak without restraint . No holds are barred . But have the results been heartening ? May we state with confidence that in such an exhibition a republic will find its greatest security ? We must not forget , to be sure , that free discussion and debate have produced beneficial results . In truth , we can say that this broke the power of Senator Joseph McCarthy , who was finally exposed in full light to the American people . If he had been `` liquidated '' in some way , he would have become a martyr , a rallying point for people who shared his ideas . Debate in the political arena can be productive of good . But it is a clumsy and wasteful process : it can produce negative results but not much that is positive . Debate rid us of McCarthy but did not give us much that is positive . It did something to clear the ground , but it erected no striking new structure ; ; it did not even provide the architect's plan for anything new . In the field of the natural sciences , scientifically verified data are quite readily available and any discussion can be shortened with good results . In the field of the social sciences a considerable fund of tested knowledge has been accumulated that can be used to good advantage . By no means would we discourage the production of ideas : they provide raw materials with which to work ; ; they provide stimulations that lead to further production . We would establish no censorship . The President's personality would have opened that office to him . And for the first time a representative of the highest office in the land would have been liable to the charge that he had attempted to make it a successorship by inheritance . It is testimony to the deep respect in which Mr. Eisenhower was held by members of all parties that the moral considerations raised by his approach to the matter were not explicitly to be broached . These began to be apparent in a press conference held during the second illness in order that the consulting specialists might clarify the President's condition for the nation . And if Howard Rutstein felt impelled thereafter to formulate the ethics of the medical profession , his article in the Atlantic Monthly accomplished a good deal more . It forced us to fix the responsibility for the position in which all medical commentators had been placed . The discussion of professional ethics inevitably reminded us that in the historical perspective the President's decision will finally clarify itself as a moral , rather than a medical , problem . Because the responsibility for resolving the issue lay with the President , rather than with his doctors , nothing raises more surely for us the difficulties simple goodness faces in dealing with complex moral problems under political pressure . For the President had dealt with the matter humbly , in what he conceived as the democratic way . But the problem is one which gives us the measure of a man , rather than a group of men , whether a group of doctors , a group of party members assembled at a dinner to give their opinion , or the masses of the voters . Any attempt to reconcile this statement of the central issue in the campaign of 1956 with the nature of the man who could not conceive it as the central issue will at least resolve our confusions about the chaotic and misleading results of the earnestness of both doctors and President in a situation which should never have arisen . It was a response to the conflict between political pressure and the moral intuition which resulted in attempts at prediction . In no other situation would a group of doctors , struggling competently to improve the life expectancy of a man beloved by the world , be subjected to such merciless and persistent questioning , and before they were prepared to demonstrate the kind of verbal precision which alone can clarify for mankind the problems it faces . And though we can look back now and see their errors , we can look back also to the ultimate error . It recurred in the press conferences : the President's remarks about his running developed a singular tone , one which we find in few statements made by public individuals on such a matter . The press conference became a stage which betrayed the drift of his private thinking , rather than his convictions . He commented -- thoughtfully , a reporter told us -- that it was `` not too important for the individual how he ends up '' . He gave us a simile to explain his admission that even at the worst period of his second illness it never occurred to him there was any renewed question about his running : as in the Battle of the Bulge , he had no fears about the outcome until he read the American newspapers . Yet the attitude that the fate of the Presidency demands in such a situation is quite distinct from the simple courage that can proceed with battles to be fought , regardless of the consequences . In this case others should not have had to raise the doubts and fears . The Presidency demands an incisive awareness of the larger implications of the death of any incumbent . It is of the utmost importance to the people of America and of the world how their governing President `` ends up '' during the four years of his term . Only when that term is ended and he is a private citizen again can he be permitted the freedom and the courage to discount the dangers of his death . Ironically enough , in this instance such personal virtues were a luxury . At the national and international level , then , what is the highest kind of morality for the private citizen represents an instance of political immorality . And we had the uneasy sense that the cleavage between the moral and the political progressed amid the events which concern us . For the tone of the editorials which greeted Mr. Eisenhower's original announcement of his running had been strangely disquieting . Neither the vibrant enthusiasm which bespeaks a people's intuitive sense of the fitness of things at climactic moments nor the vital argumentation betraying its sense that something significant has transpired was in evidence . Nothing testifies more clearly to that cleavage than the peculiar editorial page appearing in a July issue of Life Magazine , the issue which also carried the second announcement of the candidacy . The double editorial on Two Aspects Of `` The U.S. Spirit '' was subtly calculated to suggest a moral sanction for gambles great as well as small , reflecting popular approval of this questionable attitude toward the highest office in the land . `` The Moral Creed '' and `` The Will To Risk '' live happily together , if we do not examine where the line is to be drawn . `` I may possibly be a greater risk than is the normal person of my age '' , the President had said on February 29th of the election year , ignoring the fact that no one of his age had ever lived out another term . `` My doctors assure me that this increased percentage of risk is not great '' . But by the time the risk was doubled , events had dismissed from his mind both increased percentages and a previously stated intention of considering carefully anything more serious than a bout of influenza . Only infrequently did the situation color his thinking . Ironically no president we have had would have regretted more than President Eisenhower the possibility to which his own words , in the press conference held at the beginning of August , testified : that unable as he was himself to say his running was best for the country , unconsciously he had placed his party before his nation . So it is that we relive his opening statement in the first television address with the dramatic immediacy of the present . No consideration of risk urges itself upon him now : for this is what the mind does with the ideas on which it has not properly focussed . Yet with a mind less shallow , if less sharp , than some of the fortune-happy syndicates which back him , he feels what he cannot formulate ; ; and we watch him amid the overtones which suggest he could never in any conscience urge a risk upon the voters . Moving as he is into the phase of the campaign which demands conviction of him , he adopts a position that is morally indefensible . He ascribes to the mercy of God the peace which this personal matter -- the assurance that he can physically sustain the burden of the office longer than any individual in the history of our nation has been able to do -- has brought him . What is simply an opinion formed in defiance of the laws of human probability , whether or not it is later confirmed , has become by September of the election year `` a firm conviction '' . As a means of silencing a discussion which ought to have taken place , the statement is an effective one : we sympathize with the universal confusion which gives rise to such convictions . But it is also the climax to one of the absorbing chapters in our current political history . In assigning to God the responsibility which he learned could not rest with his doctors , Eisenhower gave evidence of that weakening of the moral intuition which was to characterize his administration in the years to follow . In any other man this reassurance to the electorate would have caused us a profound moral shock . About this man we had to think twice . We knew that it was , as reassurance , the ironic fruit of a deeply moral nature . But the fact remains that even the unconscious acceptance of himself as a man of destiny divinely protected must be censored in any man who evades the responsibility for his major decisions , and thus for imposing his will on the people . And in the context of drifting personal utterances we have examined , there was occasional evidence of the origin of all such evasions . When the possibility that he had not given reconsideration to so weighty a decision seemed to disconcert his questioners , Mr. Eisenhower was known to make his characteristic statement to the press that he was not going to talk about the matter any more . Thinking had stopped ; ; it was not to be resumed . The portrait that had developed , fragmentarily but consistently , was the portrait of a man to whom serious thinking is alien enough that the making of a decision inhibits , when it does not forestall , any ability to review the decision in the light of new evidence . This does not mean that the decision to run for office should inevitably have been revoked . Instead it means that the thinking in which decision issues has the power to determine the morality of the decision , as in this instance the pressure for renewed practical or legislative attention to the constitutional problems the decision had uncovered might have done . Drifting through a third illness , apparently without any provision for the handling of a major national emergency other than a talk with the vice-president , Eisenhower revealed the singularly static quality of his thinking . Despite three warnings , no sense of moral urgency impelled him to distinguish his situation , and thus his responsibilities , from Wilson's . By contrast , the energetic reaction of the leader to the full demands his decision imposes upon him strengthens the moral intuition and gives us the measure of the man . Only by means of an intensive preoccupation with the detailed considerations following from any decision can he ensure attention to the practical details to be dealt with if the implications of immorality in the major decision are effectively to be checked . In the incessant struggle with recalcitrant political fact he learns to focus the essence of a problem in the significant detail , and to articulate the distinctions which clarify the detail as significant , with what is sometimes astounding rapidity . Like Lincoln , he can distinguish his relation to God from the constitutional responsibilities a questionable decision exacts of him . Like Roosevelt , he can distinguish an attitude toward a Russian leader he may share with a host of Americans from the responsibilities diplomatic convention may impose upon him . He chooses to subordinate one to the other , sometimes reluctantly , accepting criticism for the lesser immoralities facts breed . The very nature of a choice so grounded in distinction and fact leads to the valid convictions which become force of will in the manifest leader . The capacity for making the distinctions of which diplomacy is compact , and the facility with language which can render them into validity in the eyes of other men are the leader's means for transforming the moral intuition into moral leadership . The making of distinctions , like the perception of the great distinctions made , is an inordinately difficult business . Lincoln's slow progress towards the several marking his achievement is even now unrecognizable as such , and loosely interpreted as the alternation of inconsistency with vision . But because it is the function of the mind to turn the one into the other by means of the capacities with which words endow it , we do not unwisely examine the type of distinction , in the sphere of politics , on which decisions hang . Only recently , and perhaps because a television debate can so effectively dramatize President Kennedy's extraordinary mastery of detail , have the abilities on which the capacity for making distinctions depend begun to be clearly discernible at the level of politics . In his recent evaluation of Kennedy's potentialities for leadership , Walter Lippmann has cited the `` precision '' of his mind , his `` immense command '' of factual detail , and his `` instinct for the crucial point '' as impressive in the extreme ; ; and it is surely clear that the first of these is the result of the way in which the individual's command of language interacts with the other two . For this change is not a change from one positive position to another , but a change from order and truth to disorder and negation . The liberal-conservative division , we might observe in passing , is not of itself directly involved in a private interest conflict nor even in struggle between ruling groups . Rather it is rooted in a difference of response to the threat of social disintegration . The division is not between those who wish to preserve what they have and those who want change . Rather it is a division established by two absolutely different ways of thought with regard to man's life in society . These ways are absolutely irreconcilable because they offer two different recipes for man's redemption from chaos . The civilizational crisis , the third type of change raises the question `` what are we to do '' ? On the most primitive level . For the answer cannot be derived from any socially cohesive element in the disrupting community . There is no socially existential answer to the question . For the truth formerly experienced by the community no longer has existential status in the community , nor does any answer elaborated by philosophers or theoriticians . In this phase of change , no idea has social acceptance and so none has ontological status in the community . An interregnum ensues in which not men but ideas compete for existence . If we examine the three types of change from the point of view of their internal structure we find an additional profound difference between the third and the first two , one that accounts for the notable difference between the responses they evoke . The first two types of change occur within the inward and immanent structure of the society . The first involves a simple shift of interests in the society . The second involves something deeper , but its characteristic form focuses on a shift in policy for the community , not in the truth on which the community rests . Thus in both types attention is focused on the community itself , and its phenomenological life . The third type , however , wrenches attention from the life of action and interests in the community and focuses it on the ground of being on which the community depends for its existence . Voegelin has analyzed this experience in the case of the stable , healthy community . There the community , faced with the need to formulate policy on the level of absolute justice , can find the answer to its problem in the absolute truth which it holds as partially experienced . This , however , cannot be done by a community whose very experience of truth is confused and incoherent : it has no absolute standard , and consequently cannot distinguish the absolute from the contingent . It has lost its ground of being and floats in a mist of appearances . Relativism and equality are its characteristic diseases . Precisely at the moment when it has lost its vision the mind of the community turns out from itself in a search for the ontological standard whereby it can measure itself . For paradigmatic history `` breaks '' rather than unfolds precisely when the movement is from order to disorder , and not from one order to a new order . The liberal-conservative split , to define it further , derives from a basic difference concerning the existential status of standard sought and about the spiritual experience that leads to its identification . When disruptive change has penetrated to the third level of social order , the process of disruption rapidly reaches a point of no return . Indeed , it is probable that this point is reached the moment the third level of change begins . At that point we reach the `` closed '' historical situation : the situation in which man is no longer free to return to a status quo ante . At that point men become aware of the mystery of history called variously `` fate '' , or `` destiny '' , or `` providence '' , and feel themselves caught helplessly in the writhing of a disrupted society . The reasons for this experience are rooted in the metaphysical characteristics of such a change . Of all forms of being , society , or community , has the greatest element of determinability . Its ontological status is itself most tenuous because apart from individual men , who are its `` matter '' , tradition , the `` form '' of society exists only as a shared perception of truth . The ontological status of society thus is constituted by the psychological status of society's members . The content of that psychological status determines , ultimately , the content of civilization . Those social , civilizational factors not rooted in the human spirit of the group , ultimately cease to exist . Civilization itself -- tradition -- falls out of existence when the human spirit itself becomes confused . Civilization is what man has made of himself . Its massive contours are rooted in the simple need of man , since he is always incomplete , to complete himself . It is not enough for man to be an ontological esse . He needs existential completion , he needs , that is , to move in the direction of completion . And the direction of that movement is determined by his perception of the truth about himself . He must , consequently , exist as a self-perceived substantive , developing agent , or he does not exist as man . Thus , it is no mystical intuition , but an analyzable conception to say that man and his tradition can `` fall out of existence '' . This happens at the moment man loses the perception of moral substance in himself , of a nature that , in Maritain's words , is perceived as a `` locus of intelligible necessities '' . An existentialist is a man who perceives himself only as `` esse '' , as existence without substance . Thus human perception and human volition is the immanent cause of all social change and this most truly when the change reaches the civilizational level . Thus with regard to the loss of tradition , in the change from order to disorder the metaphysics of change works itself out as a disruption of the individual soul , a change in which man continues as an objective ontological existent , but no longer as a man . Further , change is a form of motion , it occurs as the act of a being in potency insofar as it is in potency and has not yet reached the terminus of the change . With regard to the change we are examining , the question is , at what point does the change become irreversible ? A number of considerations suggest that this occurs early in the process . Change involves the displacement of form . This means that the inception of change itself can begin only when the factors conducive to change have already become more powerful than those anchoring the existent form in being . If the existent form is to be retained new factors that reinforce it must be introduced into the situation . In the case of social decay , form is displaced simply by the process of dissolution with no form at the terminus of the process . Now in the mere fact of the beginning of such displacement we have prima-facie evidence of the ontological weakness of the fading form . And when we consider the tenuous hold tradition has on existence , any weakening of that hold constitutes a crisis of existence . The retention of a tradition confronted with such a crisis necessitates the introduction of new spiritual forces into the situation . However , the crisis occurs precisely as a weakening of spiritual forces . It would seem , therefore , that in a civilizational crisis man cannot save himself . The emergence of the crisis itself would seem to constitute a warranty for the victory of disorder . And it would seem that history is a witness to this truth . As a further characterization of the liberal conservative split we may observe that it involves differences in the formula for escaping inevitabilities in history . These differences , in turn , derive from prior differences concerning the friendly or hostile character of change . Unanalyzed responses anxiety and deep insecurity are the characteristic responses evoked by the crisis in tradition . To experience them , it is not necessary for a people to be actively aware of what is happening to it . The process of erosion need only undermine the tradition and a series of consequences begin unfolding within the individual , while in institutions a quiet but deep transformation of processes occurs . Within the individual the reaction has been called various names , all , however , pointing to the same basic experience . Weil identifies it as being `` rootless '' , Guardini as being `` placeless '' , Riesman as being `` lonely '' . Others call it `` alienation '' , and mean by that no simple economic experience ( as Marx does ) but a deep spiritual sense of dislocation . Within institutions there is a marked decline of the process of persuasion and the substitution of a force-fear process which masquerades as the earlier one of persuasion . We note the use of rhetoric as a weapon , the manipulation of the masses by propaganda , the `` mobilization '' of effort and resources . Within this context of spontaneous and unanalyzed responses to the experience of civilizational crisis , two basic organizations of response are observable : reaction and ideological progressivism . These responses are explicable in terms of characteristics inherent in the crisis . Both are predictably destined to fail . The response of reaction is dominated by a concern for what is vanishing . Its essence lies in its attempt to recover previous order through the repression of disruptive forces . To this end political authority is called upon to exercise its negative and coercive powers . The implicit assumption of this response is that history is reversible . Seemingly , order is perceived as a kind of subsistent entity now covered by adventitious accretions . The problem is to remove the accretions and thereby uncover the order that was always there . Such a response , of course , misses the point that in crisis order is going out of existence . Moreover its posture of stubborn but simple resistance is doomed to failure because of the metaphysical weakness of the existent form of order , once the activation of change has reached visible proportions . The most reaction can achieve is stasis , and a stasis that can be maintained only by the expenditure of an effort which ultimately exhausts itself . Despite the hopelessness of the response , it is explicable in terms of the crisis of tradition itself . Since a civilizational crisis involves also a crisis in private interests and in the ruling class , reaction is normally found among those who feel themselves to be among the ruling class . Their great error is to mingle the responses typical of each of the three types of change . Since civilizational change is the most difficult to perceive and analyze , it seldom is given adequate attention . And the anxiety it generates is misinterpreted as anxiety over private interest and threatened social status . The basic truth in the reactionary response is to be found in its realistic assumption of the primacy of the real over the ideational . But this truth is distorted by its extreme application : the assumption of the separate existence of tradition . The reactionary misses the point that tradition exists ontologically only in the form of psychological-intellectual relations . Reactionary theories , for this reason , usually assume some form of organismic theory . In its defensive formulations , the theory will attack conscious change on the grounds of the independent existence of the community . In its dynamic form , it visualizes the community as the embodiment of an ontological force -- the race , for instance , which unfolds in history . In both cases the individual tends to be treated as an instrument of the organic reality . When the reactionary response is thus bolstered by an intellectual defense , the characteristics of that defense are explicable only in terms of the basic attitudes of unanalyzed reaction . Reaction is rooted in a perception of tradition as a whole . It is a total situation that is defended : the `` good old days '' . There is no selectivity ; ; even the questionable features of the past are defended . The point is that the reactionary , for whatever motive , perceives himself to have been part or a partner of something that extended beyond himself , something which , consequently , he was not able to accept or reject on the basis of subjective preference . The reactionary is confused about the existential status of a decaying tradition , but he does perceive the unity tradition had when it was healthy . All of which brings up another problem in the use of psychoanalytic insight in a literary work . Is the Oedipus complex , the clinical syndrome , material for a tragedy ? If we remove ourselves for a moment from our time and our infatuation with mental disease , isn't there something absurd about a hero in a novel who is defeated by his infantile neurosis ? I am not making a clinical judgment here , for such personal tragedies are real and are commonplace in the analyst's consulting room , but literature makes a different claim upon our sympathies than tragedy in life . A man in a novel who is defeated in his childhood and condemned by unconscious forces within him to tiredly repeat his earliest failure in love , only makes us a little weary of man ; ; his tragedy seems unworthy and trivial . Now we can argue that the irresistible fate of Oedipus Rex was nothing more than the irresistible unconscious longings of Oedipus projected outward , but this externalization of unconscious conflict makes all the difference between a story and a clinical case history . We can also argue that the three brothers Karamazov and Smerdyakov were the external representatives of an internal conflict within one man , Dostoevsky , a conflict having to do with father-murder and the wish to possess the father's woman . But a novel in which one man Karamazov explored the divisions within his personality would scarcely merit publication in the Psychoanalytic Quarterly . It is a mistake to look upon the Oedipus of Oedipus Complex as a literary descendant of Oedipus Rex . Whatever the psychological truth in the Oedipus myth , an Oedipus who is drawn to his fate by irresistible external forces can carry the symbol of humanity and its archaic crime , and the incest that is unknowing renews the mystery of the eternal dream of childhood and absorbs us in the secret . But a modern Oedipus who is doomed because he cannot oppose his own childhood is only pathetic , and for renouncing the mystery in favor of psychological truth he gives up the claim on our sympathies . I am suggesting that a case-history approach to the Oedipus complex is a blind alley for a storyteller . The best gifts of the novelist will be wasted on the reader who is insulated against any surprises the novelist may have in store for him . Incest is still a durable theme , but if it wants to get written about it will have to find ways to surprise the emotions , and there is no better way to do this than that of concealment and symbolic representation . And the best way to conceal and disguise the elements of an incest story is not to set out to write an incest story . Which brings to mind another Lawrence story and some interesting comparisons in the treatment of the Oedipal theme . `` The Rocking Horse Winner '' is also a story about a boy's love for his mother . If I now risk some comparisons with Sons And Lovers let it be clear that I am not comparing the two works or judging their merits ; ; I am only singling out differences in treatment of a theme and the resultant effects . `` The Rocking Horse Winner '' is a fantasy with extraordinary power to disturb the reader -- but we do not know why . It is the story of the hopeless love of a little boy for his cold and vain mother . There are ghostly scenes in which the little boy on his rocking horse rocks madly toward the climax that will magically give him the name of the winning horse . The child grows rich on his winnings and conspires with his uncle to make secret gifts of his money to his mother . The story ends in the child's illness and delirium brought on by the feverish compulsion to ride his horse to win for his mother . The child dies with his mourning mother at his bedside . I had read the story many times without asking myself why it affected me or caring why it did . But on one occasion when I encountered a similar fantasy in a little boy who was my patient I began to understand the uncanny effects of this story . It was , of course , a little boy's fantasy of winning his mother to himself , and replacing the father who could not give her the things she wanted -- a classical oedipal fantasy if you like -- but if it were only this the story would be banal . Why does the story affect us ? How does the rocking exert its uncanny effect upon the reader ? The rocking is actually felt in the story , a terrible and ominous rhythm that prophesies the tragedy . The rocking , I realized , is the single element in the story that carries the erotic message , the unspoken and unconscious undercurrent that would mar the innocence of a child's fantasy and disturb the effects of the work if it were made explicit . The rocking has the ambiguous function of keeping the erotic undercurrent silent and making it present ; ; it conceals and yet is suggestive ; ; a perfect symbol . And if we understand the rocking as an erotic symbol we can also see how well it serves as the symbol of impending tragedy . For this love of the boy for his mother is a hopeless and forbidden love , doomed by its nature . We are also struck by the fact that this story of a boy's love for his mother does not offend , while the incestuous love of the man , Paul Morel , sometimes repels . It's easy to see why . This love belongs to childhood ; ; we accord it its place there , and in Lawrence's treatment we are given the innocent fantasy of a child , in fact , the form in which oedipal love is expressed in childhood . And when the child dies in Lawrence's story in a delirium that is somehow brought on by his mania to win and to make his mother rich , the manifest absurdity of such a disease and such a death does not enter into our thoughts at all . We have so completely entered the child's fantasy that his illness and his death are the plausible and the necessary conclusion . I am sure that none of the effects of this story were consciously employed by Lawrence to describe an oedipal fantasy in childhood . It is most probable that Freud and the Oedipus complex never entered his head in the writing of this story . He was simply writing a story that wanted to be told , and in the writing a childhood fantasy of his own emerged . He would not have cared why it emerged , he only wanted to capture a memory to play with it again in his imagination and somehow to fix and hold in the story the disturbing emotions that accompanied the fantasy . In our own time we have seen that the novelist's debt to psychoanalysis has increased but that the novel itself has not profited much from this marriage . Ortega's hope that modern psychology might yet bring forth a last flowering of the novel has only been partially fulfilled . The young writer seems intimidated by psychological knowledge ; ; he has lost confidence in his own eyes and in the validity of his own psychological insights . He borrows the insights of psychology to improve his impaired vision but cannot bring to his work the distinctive vision that should be a novelist's own . He has been seduced by the marvels of the unconscious and has lost interest in studying the surfaces of character . If many of the characters in contemporary novels appear to be the bloodless relations of characters in a case history it is because the novelist is often forgetful today that those things that we call character manifest themselves in surface behavior , that the ego is still the executive agency of personality , and that all we know of personality must be discerned through the ego . The novelist who has been badly baptized in psychoanalysis often gives us the impression that since all men must have an Oedipus complex all men must have the same faces . 2 . I have argued that Oedipus of the Oedipus complex has a doubtful future as a tragic figure in literature . But a writer who has a taste for irony and who sees incest in all its modern dimensions can let his imagination work on the disturbing joke in the incest myth , the joke that strikes right at the center of man's humanness . Moral dread is seen as the other face of desire , and here psychoanalysis delivers to the writer a magnificent irony and a moral problem of great complexity . There is probably some significance in the fact that two of the best incest stories I have encountered in recent years are burlesques of the incest myth . The ancient types are reassembled in gloom and foreboding to be irresistibly drawn to their destinies , but the myth fails before the modern truth ; ; the oracle speaks false and the dream speaks true . In both the farmer's tale in Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man and in Thomas Mann's The Holy Sinner , the incest hero rises above the myth by accepting the wish as motive ; ; the heroic act is the casting off of pretense . Thomas Mann wrote The Holy Sinner in 1951 . It was conceived as a leave-taking , a kind of melancholy gathering-in of the myths of the West , `` bevor die Nacht sinkt , eine lange Nacht vielleicht und ein tiefes Vergessen '' . He chose a medieval legend of incest , Gregorius Vom Stein , and freely borrowed and parodied other myths of the West , mixing themes , language , peoples and times in a master myth in which the old forms continually renew themselves , as in his previous treatment of Joseph . But The Holy Sinner is not simply a retelling of old stories for an old man's entertainment . Mann understood better than most men the incest comedy at the center of the myth and the psychological truth in which dread is shown as the other face as longing was for him just the kind of deep and complicated joke he liked to tell . And when he retold the legend of Gregorius he interpolated a modern version in which the medieval players speak contemporary thoughts in archaic language ; ; while they move through the pageantry of the ancient incest myth and cover themselves through not-knowing , they reveal the unconscious motive in seeking each other and in the last scene make an extraordinary confession of guilt in the twentieth-century manner . Grigorss is the child of an incestuous union between a royal brother and sister , the twins Sibylla and Wiligis . He is born in secrecy after the death of his father and cast adrift soon after birth . The infant is discovered by a fisherman who brings him home to rear him . An ivory tablet in the infant's cask recounts the story of his sinful origins and is preserved for the child by the monks of a monastery in the fishing village . Grigorss , at seventeen , learns his story and goes forth as a knight to uncover his origins . His sailing vessel is guided by fate to the shores of his own country at a time when Sibylla's domain is overrun by the armies of one of her rejected suitors . Grigorss overcomes the suitor in battle , delivers the city from its oppressors and marries Sibylla who had fallen in love with the beautiful knight the moment she saw him . Sibylla is pregnant with their second child when she finds the ivory tablet concealed by her husband , and the identities of mother and son are revealed . Grigorss goes off to do penance on a rock for seventeen years . At the end of this period two pious Christians in Rome receive the revelation which leads them to seek the next Pope on the rock . Grigorss comes to Rome and becomes a great and beloved Pope . In the last pages of the book Sibylla comes to Rome to seek an audience with the great Pope and to give her confession . Mother and son recognize each other and , in Mann's version of this legend , make a remarkable confession of guilt to each other , the confession of unconscious motive and unconscious knowledge of their true identities from the time they had first set eyes on each other . In recollection he has said : `` Natural or man-made objects kept coming into my head , but I would suppress them sternly '' . Moreover , he organized the movement of his forms , within his rigorously shaped space , into highly complex equilibriums ; ; and used gradations of color value as well as sharply contrasting elementary colors . The worthy Mondrian , seeing these pictures , said in a tone of kindly reproof : `` But you are really an artist of the naturalistic tradition '' ! Helion did not realize it at the time , but it was true . His `` monumental '' abstraction , made up of smooth , metallic `` non-objects '' acting upon each other with great tension , won Helion much acclaim during the 'thirties . The play of novel lighting effects also entered into these compositions , whose controlled power and varied activity made them well worth meditating . As Helion's work showed more and more nostalgia for the world of man and nature , the pure abstractionists expressed some disapproval ; ; but Leger , Arp , Lipchitz and Alexander Calder , at the time , gave him their blessing . His canvases nowadays bore titles frankly declaring them to be `` Figures In Space '' , or `` Blue Figure '' , or `` Pink Figure '' ; ; and they had ( vaguely ) heads and feet . Exhibited in shows in London in 1935 , and in New York the following year , the new , more elaborated abstracts were much favored in the circles of the modernists as three-dimentional dramas of great intellectual coherence . At this period the thirty-year old Helion was ranked `` as one of the mature leaders of the modern movement '' , according to Herbert Read , `` and in the direct line of descent from Cezanne , Seurat , Gris and Leger '' . In America , Meyer Schapiro observed that , unlike the Mondrian school , Helion `` sought a return path to the fullness of nature within the framework of abstract art '' . It is notable that at this time he was writing with admiration of Cimabue's and Poussin's way of filling space . Abstract art was still the right path for him ; ; but , he held , instead of continuing as an `` art of reduction '' , it must grow , must make a place for the contributions of the Raphaels and Poussins as well as for those of the early cubists and Mondrian . Later Helion wrote of this phase : `` For years I built for myself a subtle instrument of relationships -- colors and forms without a name . I played on it my secret songs , unexplained , passionate and peaceful '' . But his own work was evolving further . The extreme limitations he sensed in all current abstract art made that seem to him increasingly arid and cold . He was engaged in constant experiments that searched for new directions . Where would it all lead ? He himself did not know , as he said in 1935 . But he was `` afraid of the future -- he would in fact welcome a way back to social integration , a functional art of some kind '' . During the 1920's the Abstractionists , the German Bauhaus group of industrial designers , and the new architects all had the dream of some well ordered utopia , or welfare state , in which their neat and logical constructions might find their proper place . But whereas the postwar American abstractionists seem to Helion to be determined to `` escape '' from the real world , or simply to rebel against it , the ordered abstractions which he and his associates of the 1930's were painting embodied the hope of `` improving '' things . `` We were possessed by visions of a new civilization to come , very pure and elevated '' , he has said , `` in fact some ideal form of socialism such as we had dreamed of since the war of 1914-1918 '' . Instead of this the 1930's witnessed a tragic economic depression , the rise of Fascist dictators in Europe , the wasting Civil War in Spain . Very much the political man , Helion felt himself deeply affected by the increasingly pessimistic atmosphere of France and all Europe , whose foundations seemed to him more and more shaky . In 1936 he decided to migrate to America . The Rooseveltian America was a haven of liberalism and progress and seemed to him to constitute the last best hope for civilization . Helion also hoped that America's mastery of technology and industrial efficiency would be accompanied by the production of new and beautiful art works . `` I arrived in the United States with the idea of establishing myself there more or less permanently and finding inspiration for new compositions '' . In New York he was well received by what was then only a small brave band of non-figurative artists , including Alexander Calder , George K. L. Morris , De Kooning , Holty and a few others . After a year in a studio on Sheridan Square , having married an American girl who was a native of Virginia , Helion moved to a village in the Blue Ridge mountains , where he produced some of the most imposing of his abstract canvases . The darkening world scene , at the time of the Munich Pact , continued to trouble his mind even in his remote Virginia studio . `` Fear possessed me , and the certainty of war '' , he has related . `` I truly smelled blood , death , heaps of corpses everywhere '' . In haste he labored to finish some last abstract paintings : a three-panel frieze , with a flying figure and a fallen figure ; ; a `` Double-Figure '' , which went to the Chicago Art Institute , and is considered by him the most successful of his abstracts ; ; and in early 1939 , a `` Fallen Figure '' of very ominous character , which concluded his abstract phase . `` I knew I was carrying on with abstraction to its very end -- for me '' , he said of the two years' output in Virginia . With those paintings of big constructions crashing down , he felt he could stop . They were , in effect his last testament to non-objective art . He had taken out first papers for American citizenship ; ; but after war came to Europe , he decided to return to France , arriving there in January , 1940 . `` I hated the war '' , he said , `` but thought I ought to go because I was , perhaps , one of those who hadn't done enough to prevent it '' . In June , 1940 , Sergeant Helion , with a company of reserve troops waiting to go into battle , was sketching the hills south of the Loire River , when the war suddenly rolled in upon him . Its first apparition was a long , gloomy column of refugees riding in farm wagons , or pushing prams . His company then carried out a confused retreating movement until it was surrounded by the Germans , a few days before France capitulated . After a sort of death march during four days without food , Helion and his comrades were shipped by cattle-car to a labor camp at an estate farm in East Germany . A year later they were removed to a Stalag in the harbor of Stettin . At the time of his capture Helion had on his person a sketchbook he had bought at Woolworth's in New York . When he was stripped , deloused and numbered by his guards , his much-thumbed sketchbook was seized and thrown on a pile of prisoners' goods to be confiscated . `` It was then I knew that they were making war against Man , the individual within ! -- who questioned things when given orders '' . At Stettin the university-educated artist , who had studied German , was chosen to serve as interpreter and clerk in the office of the Stalag commander . In secret he also acted as a member of the prisoners' Central Committee , which plotted sabotage , planned a few escapes , and maintained a hidden control over the wretched French slave-laborers . In the Stalag , Helion came to know and love his comrades , most of them plain folk , who , in their extremity , showed true courage and ran great risks to help each other . How much they esteemed him is shown by the fact that their underground committee selected him as one of the few who would be helped to escape . In the prison camp's Black Market civilian clothes were quietly bought and forged papers were devised for him ; ; during long weeks the plan for his flight was rehearsed . Every morning contingents of prisoners would be sent out to labor in nearby factories . One evening , while a volley-ball game was being played in the yard among the prisoners remaining there , a simulated melee was staged -- just as the gates were opened to admit other prisoners returning from work . As Helion wrote afterward : `` Their sentry followed . Four hands were stretched toward me by my comrades behind me . Marquet held my briefcase ; ; Finot held a wallet with my money and papers ; ; Moineau and David held nothing but their fingers . They felt rough and kind and warm . At this moment the volley-ball hit the ground . Duclos ran toward Desprez with fists raised . The guards all rushed up to intervene '' Shedding his prison cloak , Helion shot through the gates , now clad in civilian garments and with the passport of a Flemish worker . Riding trains , hitching hikes on trucks across Germany , slipping through guarded frontiers with the help of secret guides , he eventually reached Vichy France , and , by the winter of 1943 , was back in Virginia . He wrote : `` To escape from a prison camp required a very special state of mind ; ; not only loathing of captivity , but a faith , a hope that is even stronger . I left behind me brave men , whom captivity had robbed of all hope . They too loved their families , longed for their villages : yet lacked the faith that drove one to dare the fearful chance of escape '' . It was a time of revelations for him . Even the most rational of men , under great stress , may be transported by a new faith and behave like mystics . Helion knew that he owed his freedom as much to the self-sacrifice of his fellow-men in Arbeitskommando 13 , , Stettin , as to his own fierce will and love of life . After that , he declared , `` to return to freedom was to fall to one's knees before the real world and adore it '' . In prison he had been able to sketch nothing but figures from life , his guards , his companions in misery . Now all his desires centered on `` rediscovering and singing of the prosaic and yet beautiful world of men and objects so long barred from me by a barbed wire fence '' . And , he added : `` During the many months in prison camp , all abstract images vanished from my mind '' . Before leaving for America , he happened to see his old friend Jean Arp and confided to him his new resolutions . Arp protested : `` But it is impossible ! Everything in the way of representation has already been done by the old masters '' . Helion , however , clung to the belief that `` in escaping from the Stalag I had also escaped from Abstraction '' . While convalescing in his Virginia home he wrote a book recording his prison experiences and escape , entitled : They Shall Not Have Me Published originally in ( Helion's ) English by Dutton & Co. of New York , in 1943 , the book was received by the press as a work of astonishing literary power and one of the most realistic accounts of World War 2 , from the French side . It was very widely read , too ; ; and the author , who seemed the embodiment of France's rising spirit of resistance to her conquerors , was much complimented for his daring military action . But when he showed his new figurative pictures to his artist friends of the abstract camp , they paid him no compliments and drew long faces . Between 1944 and 1947 Helion had a series of one-man shows -- at the Paul Rosenberg Gallery in New York and in Paris -- of his new realistic pictures . They reincarnated the figures of human beings banished from his canvases since the 1920's . These new pictures focussed on the familiar and commonplace objects that he had heard the men in his prison camp talking about as the things they missed most , hence associated with the sense of lost freedom : the cafe at the corner , the newspaper kiosk , the girls in doorways and windows along the street , the golden-crusted French bread they lacked , the cigarettes denied them . One of the pictures was of a man with hat drawn over his face ceremoniously lighting a cigarette ; ; others were of men doffing their hats to each other , carrying umbrellas with pomp , reading newspapers , or simply showing loaves of bread spread out . Important as was Mr. O'Donnell's essay , his thesis is so restricting as to deny Faulkner the stature which he obviously has . He and also Mr. Cowley and Mr. Warren have fallen to the temptation which besets many of us to read into our authors -- Nathaniel Hawthorne , for example , and Herman Melville -- protests against modernism , material progress , and science which are genuine protests of our own but may not have been theirs . Faulkner's total works today , and in fact those of his works which existed in 1946 when Mr. Cowley made his comment , or in 1939 , when Mr. O'Donnell wrote his essay , reveal no such simple attitude toward the South . If he is a traditionalist , he is an eclectic traditionalist . If he condemns the recent or the present , he condemns the past with no less force . If he sees the heroic in a Sartoris or a Sutpen , he sees also -- and he shows -- the blind and the mean , and he sees the Compson family disintegrating from within . If the barn-burner's family produces a Flem Snopes , who personifies commercialism and materialism in hyperbolic crassness , the Compson family produces a Jason Compson 4 . Faulkner is a most untraditional traditionalist . Others writing on Faulkner have found the phrase `` traditional moralist '' either inadequate or misleading . Among them are Frederick J. Hoffman , William Van O'Connor , and Mrs. Olga Vickery . They have indicated the direction but they have not been explicit enough , I believe , in pointing out Faulkner's independence , his questioning if not indeed challenging the Southern tradition . Faulkner's is not the mind of the apologist which Mr. O'Donnell implies that it is . He is not one to remain more comfortably and unquestioningly within a body of social , cultural , or literary traditions than he was within the traditions -- or possibly the regulations -- governing his tenure in the post office at Oxford , Mississippi , thirty-five years ago . That is not to deny that he has been aware of traditions , of course , that he is steeped in them , in fact , or that he has dealt with them , in his books . It is to say rather , I believe , that he has brought to bear on the history , the traditions , and the lore of his region a critical , skeptical mind -- the same mind which has made of him an inveterate experimenter in literary form and technique . He has employed from his section rich immediate materials which in a loose sense can be termed Southern . The fact that he has cast over those materials the light of a skeptical mind does not make him any the less Southern , I rather think , for the South has been no more solid than other regions except in the political and related areas where patronage and force and intimidation and fear may produce a surface uniformity . Some of us might be inclined to argue , in fact , that an independence of mind and action and an intolerance of regimentation , either mental or physical , are particularly Southern traits . There is no necessity , I suppose , to assert that Mr. Faulkner is Southern . It would not be easy to discover a more thoroughly Southern pedigree than that of his family . And , after all , he has lived comfortably at both Oxford , Mississippi , and Charlottesville , Virginia . The young William Faulkner in New Orleans in the 1920's impressed the novelist Hamilton Basso as obviously conscious of being a Southerner , and there is no evidence that since then he has ever considered himself any less so . Besides showing no inclination , apparently , to absent himself from his native region even for short periods , and in addition writing a shelf of books set in the region , he has handled in those books an astonishingly complete list of matters which have been important in the South during the past hundred years . It is more difficult with Faulkner than with most authors to say what is the extent and what is the source of his knowledge . His own testimony is that he has read very little in the history of the South , implying that what he knows of that history has come to him orally and that he knows the world around him primarily from his own unassisted observation . His denials of extensive reading notwithstanding , it is no doubt safe to assume that he has spent time schooling himself in Southern history and that he has gained some acquaintance with the chief literary authors who have lived in the South or have written about the South . To believe otherwise would be unrealistic . But in looking at Faulkner against his background in Mississippi and the South , it is important not to lose the broader perspective . His earliest work reflected heavy influences from English and continental writers . Evidence is plentiful that early and later also he has been indebted to the Gothic romancers , who deal in extravagant horror , to the symbolists writing at the end of the preceding century , and in particular to the stream-of-consciousness novelists , Henry James and James Joyce among them . His repeated experimentation with the techniques of fiction testifies to an independence of mind and an originality of approach , but it also shows him touching at many points the stream of literary development back of him . My intention , therefore , is not to say that Faulkner's awareness has been confined within the borders of the South , but rather that he has looked at his world as a Southerner and that presumably his outlook is Southern . The ingredients of Faulkner's novels and stories are by no means new with him , and most of the problems he takes up have had the attention of authors before him . A useful comment on his relation to his region may be made , I think , by noting briefly how in handling Southern materials and Southern problems he has deviated from the pattern set by other Southern authors while remaining faithful to the essential character of the region . The planter aristocracy has appeared in literature at least since John Pendleton Kennedy published Swallow-Barn in 1832 and in his genial portrait of Frank Meriwether presiding over his plantation dominion initiated the most persistent tradition of Southern literature . The thoroughgoing idealization of the planter society did not come , however , until after the Civil War when Southern writers were eager to defend a way of life which had been destroyed . As they looked with nostalgia to a society which had been swept away , they were probably no more than half-conscious that they painted in colors which had never existed . Their books found no less willing readers outside than inside the South , even while memories of the war were still sharp . The tradition reached its apex , perhaps , in the works of Thomas Nelson Page toward the end of the century , and reappeared undiminished as late as 1934 in the best-selling novel So Red The Rose , by Stark Young . Although Faulkner was the heir in his own family to this tradition , he did not have Stark Young's inclination to romanticize and sentimentalize the planter society . The myth of the Southern plantation has had only a tangential relation with actuality , as Francis Pendleton Gaines showed forty years ago , and I suspect it has had a far narrower acceptance as something real than has generally been supposed . Faulkner has found it useful , but he has employed it with his habitual independence of mind and skeptical outlook . Without saying or seeming to say that in portraying the Sartoris and the Compson families Faulkner's chief concern is social criticism , we can say nevertheless that through those families he dramatizes his comment on the planter dynasties as they have existed since the decades before the Civil War . It may be that in this comment he has broken from the conventional pattern more violently than in any other regard , for the treatment in his books is far removed from even the genial irony of Ellen Glasgow , who was the only important novelist before him to challenge the conventional picture of planter society . Faulkner's low-class characters had but few counterparts in earlier Southern novels dealing with plantation life . They have an ancestry extending back , however , at least to 1728 , when William Byrd described the Lubberlanders he encountered in the back country of Virginia and North Carolina . The chief literary antecedents of the Snopes clan appeared in the realistic , humorous writing which originated in the South and the Southwest in the three decades before the Civil War . These narratives of coarse action and crude language appeared first in local newspapers , as a rule , and later found their way between book covers , though rarely into the planters' libraries beside the morocco-bound volumes of Horace , Mr. Addison , Mr. Pope , and Sir Walter Scott . There is evidence to suggest , in fact , that many authors of the humorous sketches were prompted to write them -- or to make them as indelicate as they are -- by way of protesting against the artificial refinements which had come to dominate the polite letters of the South . William Gilmore Simms , sturdy realist that he was , pleaded for a natural robustness such as he found in his favorites the great Elizabethans , to vivify the pale writings being produced around him . Simms admired the raucous tales emanating from the backwoods , but he had himself social affiliations which would not allow him to approve them fully . Augustus Baldwin Longstreet , a preacher and a college and university president in four Southern states , published the earliest of these backwoods sketches and in the character Ransy Sniffle , in the accounts of sharp horse-trading and eye-gouging physical combat , and in the shockingly unliterary speech of his characters , he set an example followed by many after him . Others who wrote of low characters and low life included Thomas Bangs Thorpe , creator of the Big Bear Of Arkansas and Tom Owen , the Bee-Hunter ; ; Johnson Jones Hooper , whose character Simon Suggs bears a close kinship to Flem Snopes in both his willingness to take cruel advantage of all and sundry and the sharpness with which he habitually carried out his will ; ; and George Washington Harris , whose Tennessee hillbilly character Sut Lovingood perpetrated more unmalicious mischief and more unintended pain than any other character in literature . It would be profitable , I believe , to read these realistic humorists alongside Faulkner's works , the thought being not that he necessarily read them and owed anything to them directly , but rather that they dealt a hundred years ago with a class of people and a type of life which have continued down to our time , to Faulkner's time . Such a comparison reminds us that in employing low characters in his works Faulkner is recording actuality in the South and moreover is following a long-established literary precedent . Such characters , with their low existence and often low morality , produce humorous effects in his novels and tales , as they did in the writing of Longstreet and Hooper and Harris , but it need not be added that he gives them far subtler and more intricate functions than they had in the earlier writers ; ; nor is there need to add that among them are some of the most highly individualized and most successful of his characters . One of the early humorists already mentioned , Thomas Bangs Thorpe , can be used to illustrate another point where Faulkner touches authentic Southern materials and also earlier literary treatment of those materials . Thorpe came to Louisiana from the East as a young man prepared to find in the new country the setting of romantic adventure and idealized beauty . But Thorpe saw also the hardships of pioneer existence , the cultural poverty of the frontier settlements , and the slack morality which abounded in the new regions . As a consequence of the tensions thus produced in his thoughts and feelings , he wrote on the one hand sketches of idealized hunting trips and on the other an anecdote of the village of Hardscrabble , Arkansas , where no one had ever seen a piano ; ; and he wrote also the masterpiece of frontier humor , `` The Big Bear Of Arkansas '' , in which earthy realism is placed alongside the exaggeration of the backwoods tall-tale and the awe with which man contemplates the grandeur and the mysteries of nature . Some years ago Julian Huxley proposed to an audience made up of members of the British Association for the Advancement of Science that `` man's supernormal or extra-sensory faculties are ( now ) in the same case as were his mathematical faculties during the ice age '' . As a Humanist , Dr. Huxley interests himself in the possibilities of human development , and one thing we can say about this suggestion , which comes from a leading zoologist , is that , so far as he is concerned , the scientific outlook places no rigid limitation upon the idea of future human evolution . This text from Dr. Huxley is sometimes used by enthusiasts to indicate that they have the permission of the scientists to press the case for a wonderful unfoldment of psychic powers in human beings . There may be a case of this sort , but it is not one we wish to argue , here . Even if people do , in a not far distant future , begin to read one another's minds , there will still be the question of whether what you find in another man's mind is especially worth reading -- worth more , that is , than what you can read in good books . Even if men eventually find themselves able to look through walls and around corners , one may question whether this will help them to live better lives . There would be side-conclusions to be drawn , of course ; ; such capacities are impressive evidence pointing to a conception of the human being which does not appear in the accounts of biologists and organic evolutionists ; ; but the basic puzzles of existence would still be puzzling , and we should still have to work out the sort of problems we plan to discuss in this article . All we want from Dr. Huxley's statement is the feeling that this is an open world , in the view of the best scientific opinion , with practically no directional commitments as to what may happen next , and no important confinements with respect to what may be possible . It seems quite obvious that all the really difficult tasks of human beings arise from the fact that man is not one , but many . Each man , that is , is both one and many . He is a dreamer of the good society with a plan to put into effect , and he is an individual craftsman with something to make for himself and the people of his time . He is a parent with a child to nurture , here and now , and he is an educator who worries about the children half way round the world . He is a utopian with a stake in tomorrow and he is a vulnerable human made captive by the circumstances of today . He can sacrifice himself for tomorrow and he can sacrifice tomorrow for himself . He is a Craig's wife who agonizes about tobacco ash on the living room rug and he is a forgetful genius who goes boating with the town baker when dignitaries from the local university have come to call . He is the stern guardian of the status quo who has raised the utilitarian structures of the age , and he is the revolutionary poet with a gun in his hand who writes a tragic apologetic to posterity for the men he has killed . What will be the final symmetry of the good society ? For what do the utopians labor ? Here , on a desk , is a stack of pamphlets representing the efforts of some of the best men of the day to penetrate these questions . The pamphlets are about law , the corporation , forms of government , the idea of freedom , the defense of liberty , the various lethargies which overtake our major institutions , the gap between traditional social ideals and the working mechanisms that have been set in motion for their realization . The thing that is notable in all these discussions is the lack of ideological ardor . There is another kind of ardor , a quiet , sure devotion to the fundamental decencies of human life , but no angry utopian contentions . Actually , you could wish for some passion , now and then , but when you look around the world and see the little volcanos of current history which partisan social passions have wrought , you are glad that in these pamphlets there is at least some civilized calm . You could also say that in these pamphlets is a relieving quality of maturity . There is essential pleasantness in reading the writing of men who are not angry , who can contend without quarreling . This is the good kind of sophistication , and with all our problems and crises this kind of sophistication has flowered in the United States during recent years . A characteristic expression of such concern and inquiry is found in Joseph P. Lyford's Introduction To The Agreeable Autocracies , a recent paperback study of the institutions of modern democratic society . Mr. Lyford gives voice to a temper that represents , we think , an achieved plateau of reflective thinking . After casting about for a way of describing this spirit , we decided that it would be better to use Mr. Lyford's introduction as an illustration . He begins : `` At one time it seemed as if the Soviet Union had done us a favor by providing a striking example of how not to behave towards other peoples and other nations . As things turned out , however , we have not profited greatly from the lesson : instead of persistently following a national program of our own we have often been satisfied to be against whatever Soviet policy seemed to be at the moment . Such activity may or may not have irritated the Kremlin , but it has frequently condemned America to an unnatural defensiveness that has undermined our effort to give leadership to the free world . The defensiveness has been exaggerated by another bad habit , our tendency to rate the `` goodness '' or `` badness '' of other nations by the extent to which they applaud the slogans we circulate about ourselves . Since the slogans have little application to reality and are sanctimonious to boot , the applause is faint even in areas of the world where we should expect to find the greatest affection for free government . Shocked at the response to our proclamations , we grow more defensive , and worse , we lose our sense of humor and proportion . Mr. Nehru is subjected to stern lectures on neutralism by our Department of State , and an American President observes sourly that Sweden would be a little less neurotic if it were a little more capitalistic '' . One thing you can say about Mr. Lyford is that he does not suffer from any insecurity as an American . Those who are insecure fear to be candid in self-examination . Only the strong look squarely at weakness . The maturity in this point of view lies in its recognition that no basic problem is ever solved without being clearly understood . Mr. Lyford continues : `` Even if the self portrait we distribute for popular consumption were accurate it would be dangerous to present it as a picture of the ideal society . We would be ignoring the special circumstances of other countries . The picture is the more treacherous when it misrepresents the facts of American life . The discrepancy between what we commonly profess and what we practice or tolerate is great , and it does not escape the notice of others . If our sincerity is granted , and it is granted , the discrepancy can only be explained by the fact that we have come to believe hearsay and legend about ourselves in preference to an understanding gained by earnest self-examination . What is more , the legends have become so sacrosanct that the very habit of self-examination or self-criticism smells of low treason , and men who practice it are defeatists and unpatriotic scoundrels . Although we continue to pay our conversational devotions to `` free private enterprise '' , `` individual initiative '' , `` the democratic way '' , `` government of the people '' , `` competition of the marketplace '' , etc. , we live rather comfortably in a society in which economic competition is diminishing in large areas , bureaucracy is corroding representative government , technology is weakening the citizen's confidence in his own power to make decisions , and the threat of war is driving him economically and physically into the ground '' . The interesting thing about Mr. Lyford's approach , and the approach of the contributors to The Agreeable Autocracies ( Oceana Publications , 1961 ) to the situation of American civilization , is that it is concerned with comprehending the psychological relationships which are having a decisive effect on American life . In an ideological argument , the participants tend to thump the table . They are determined to prove something . The new spirit , so well illustrated by Mr. Lyford's work , is wholly free of this anxiety . The problem is rather to find out what is actually happening , and this is especially difficult for the reason that `` we are busily being defended from a knowledge of the present , sometimes by the very agencies -- our educational system , our mass media , our statesmen -- on which we have had to rely most heavily for understanding of ourselves '' . The Introduction continues : `` We experience a vague uneasiness about events , a suspicion that our political and economic institutions , like the genie in the bottle , have escaped confinement and that we have lost the power to recall them . We feel uncomfortable at being bossed by a corporation or a union or a television set , but until we have some knowledge about these phenomena and what they are doing to us , we can hardly learn to control them . It does not appear that we will be delivered from our situation by articles on The National Purpose . The Agreeable Autocracies is an attempt to explore some of the institutions which both reflect and determine the character of the free society today . The men who speculate on these institutions have , for the most part , come to at least one common conclusion : that many of the great enterprises and associations around which our democracy is formed are in themselves autocratic in nature , and possessed of power which can be used to frustrate the citizen who is trying to assert his individuality in the modern world '' . These institutions which Mr. Lyford names `` agreeable autocracies '' -- where did they come from ? Of one thing we can be sure : they were not sketched out by the revolutionary theorists of the eighteenth century who formulated the political principles and originally shaped the political institutions of what we term the `` free society '' . No doubt there are historians who can explain to a great extent what happened to the plans and projects of the eighteenth century . Going back over this ground and analyzing the composition of forces which have created the present scene is one of the tasks undertaken by the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions , in Santa Barbara . But however we come , finally , to explain and account for the present , the truth we are trying to expose , right now , is that the makers of constitutions and the designers of institutions find it difficult if not impossible to anticipate the behavior of the host of all their enterprises . The host is the flowing life of the human race . This life has its own currents and rhythms , its own multiple cycles and adaptations . On occasion it produces extraordinary novelties . Should Rousseau have been able to leave room in his social theory for the advent of television , atomic energy , and IBM machines ? How would Thomas Jefferson feel after reading Factories In The Field ? They tell us , sir , that we are free , because we have in one hand a ballot , and in the other a stock certificate . With these we shape our destiny and own private property , and that , sir , makes ours the best of all possible societies . The reality of the situation , however , is described by Mr. Lyford : `` Many of us may even be secretly relieved at having a plausible excuse to delegate ancient civic responsibilities to a new bureaucracy of experts . Thus the member of an industrial union comes to regard his officers as business agents who may proceed without interference or recall ; ; the stockholder delivers his proxy ; ; and the citizen narrows his political participation to the mere act of voting -- if he votes at all '' . Copernicus did not question it , Ptolemy could not . Given the conceptual context within which ancient thought thrived , how could anyone have questioned this principle ? The reasons for this are partly observational , partly philosophical , and reinforced by other aesthetic and cultural factors . First , the observational reasons . The obvious natural fact to ancient thinkers was the diurnal rotation of the heavens . Not only did constellations like Draco , Cepheus , and Cassiopeia spin circles around the pole , but stars which were not circumpolar rose and set at the same place on the horizon each night . Nor did a constellation's stars vary in brightness during the course of their nocturnal flights . The conclusion -- the distances of the constellations did not vary and their paths were circular . Moreover , the sun's path over earth described a segment of a great circle ; ; this was clear from the contour of the shadow traced by a gnomon before and after noon . As early as the 6th century B.C. the earth was seen to be spherical . Ships disappear hull-first over the horizon ; ; approaching shore their masts appeared first . Earth , being at the center of the universe , would have the same shape as the latter ; ; so , e.g. did Aristotle argue , although this may not be an observational reason in favor of circularity . The discoid shapes of sun and moon were also felt to indicate the shape of celestial things . In light of all this , one would require special reasons for saying that the paths of the heavenly bodies were other than circular . Why , for example , should the ancients have supposed the diurnal rotation of the heavens to be elliptical ? Or oviform ? Or angular ? There were no reasons for such suppositions then . This , conjoined with the considerations above , made the circular motions of heavenly bodies appear an almost directly observed fact . Additional philosophical considerations , advanced notably by Aristotle , supported further the circularity principle . By distinguishing superlunary ( celestial ) and sublunary ( terrestrial ) existence , and reinforcing this with the four-element physics of Empedocles , Aristotle came to speak of the stars as perfect bodies , which moved in only a perfect way , viz. in a perfect circle . Now what is perfect motion ? It must , apparently , be motion without termini . Because motion which begins and ends at discrete places would ( e.g. for Aristotle ) be incomplete . Circular motion , however , since it is eternal and perfectly continuous , lacks termini . It is never motion towards something . Only imcomplete , imperfect things move towards what they lack . Perfect , complete entities , if they move at all , do not move towards what they lack . They move only in accordance with what is in their natures . Thus , circular motion is itself one of the essential characteristics of completely perfect celestial existence . To return now to the four-element physics , a mixture of muddy , frothy water will , when standing in a jar , separate out with earth at the bottom , water on top , and the air on top of that . A candle alight in the air directs its flame and smoke upwards . This gives a clue to the cosmical order of elements . Thus earth has fallen to the center of the universe . It is covered ( partly ) with water , air is atop of that . Pure fire ( the stars ) is in the heavens . When combined with the metaphysical notion that pure forms of this universe are best appreciated when least embodied in a material substratum , it becomes clear that while earth will be dross on a scale of material-formal ratios , celestial bodies will be of a subtle , quickened , ethereal existence , in whose embodiment pure form will be the dominant component and matter will be absent or remain subsidiary . The stars constitute an order of existence different from what we encounter on earth . This is clear when one distinguishes the types of motion appropriate to both regions . A projectile shot up from earth returns rectlinearly to its ' natural ' place of rest . But the natural condition for the heavenly bodies is neither rest , nor rectilinear motion . Being less encumbered by material embodiments they partake more of what is divine . Their motion will be eternal and perfect . Let us re-examine the publicized contrasts between Ptolemaic and Copernican astronomy . Bluntly , there never was a Ptolemaic system of astronomy . Copernicus' achievement was to have invented systematic astronomy . The Almagest and The Hypotheses outline Ptolemy's conception of his own task as the provision of computational tables , independent calculating devices for the prediction of future planetary perturbations . Indeed , in the Halma edition of Theon's presentation of The Hypotheses there is a chart setting out ( under six distinct headings ) otherwise unrelated diagrams for describing the planetary motions . No attempt is made by Ptolemy to weld into a single scheme ( a-la-Aristotle ) , these independent predicting-machines . They all have this in common : the earth is situated near the center of the deferent . But that one should superimpose all these charts , run a pin through the common point , and then scale each planetary deferent larger and smaller ( to keep the epicycles from ' bumping ' ) , this is contrary to any intention Ptolemy ever expresses . He might even suppose the planets to move at infinity . Ptolemy's problem is to forecast where , against the inverted bowl of night , some particular light will be found at future times . His problem concerns longitudes , latitudes , and angular velocities . The distances of these points of light is a problem he cannot master , beyond crude conjectures as to the orderings of the planetary orbits viewed outward from earth . But none of this has prevented scientists , philosophers , and even historians of science , from speaking of the Ptolemaic system , in contrast to the Copernican . This is a mistake . It is engendered by confounding the Aristotelian cosmology in The Almagest with the geocentric astronomy . Ptolemy recurrently denies that he could ever explain planetary motion . This is what necessitates the nonsystematic character of his astronomy . So when textbooks , like that of Baker set out drawings of the ' Ptolemaic System ' , complete with earth in the center and the seven heavenly bodies epicyclically arranged on their several deferents , we have nothing but a misleading 20th-century idea of what never existed historically . It is the chief merit in Copernicus' work that all his planetary calculations are interdependent . He cannot , e.g. compute the retrograde arc traveled by Mars , without also making suppositions about the earth's own motion . He cannot describe eclipses without entertaining some form of a three-body problem . In Ptolemaic terms , however , eclipses and retrograde motion were phenomena simpliciter , to be explained directly as possible resultants of epicyclical combinations . In a systematic astronomy , like that of Copernicus , retrogradations become part of the conceptual structure of the system ; ; they are no longer a puzzling aspect of intricately variable , local planetary motions . Another contrast stressed when discussing Ptolemaic vs. Copernican astronomy , turns on the idea of simplicity . It is often stated that Copernican astronomy is ' simpler ' than Ptolemaic . Some even say that this is the reason for the ultimate acceptance of the former . Thus , Margenau remarks : `` A large number of unrelated epicycles was needed to explain the observations , but otherwise the ( Ptolemaic ) system served well and with quantitative precision . Copernicus , by placing the sun at the center of the planetary universe , was able to reduce the number of epicycles from eighty-three to seventeen . Historical records indicate that Copernicus was unaware of the fundamental aspects of his so-called ' revolution ' , unaware perhaps of its historical importance , he rested content with having produced a simpler scheme for prediction . As an illustration of the principle of simplicity the heliocentric discovery has a peculiar appeal because it allows simplicity to be arithmetized ; ; it involves a reduction in the number of epicycles from eighty-three to seventeen '' . Without careful qualification this can be misleading . If in any one calculation Ptolemy had had to invoke 83 epicycles all at once , while Copernicus never required more than one third this number , then ( in the sense obvious to Margenau ) Ptolemaic astronomy would be simpler than Copernican . But no single planetary problem ever required of Ptolemy more than six epicycles at one time . This , of course , results from the non-systematic , ' cellular ' character of Ptolemaic theory . Calculations within the Copernican framework always raised questions about planetary configurations . These could be met only by considering the dynamical elements of several planets at one time . This is more ambitious than Ptolemy is ever required to be when he faces his isolated problems . Thus , in no ordinary sense of ' simplicity ' is the Ptolemaic theory simpler than the Copernican . The latter required juggling several elements simultaneously . This was not simpler but much more difficult than exercises within Ptolemy's astronomy . Analogously , anyone who argues that Einstein's theory of gravitation is simpler than Newton's , must say rather more to explain how it is that the latter is mastered by student-physicists , while the former can be managed ( with difficulty ) only by accomplished experts . In a sense , Einstein's theory is simpler than Newton's , and there is a corresponding sense in which Copernicus' theory is simpler than Ptolemy's . But ' simplicity ' here refers to systematic simplicity . The number of primitive ideas in systematically-simple theories is reduced to a minimum . The Axioms required to make the theoretical machinery operate are set out tersely and powerfully , so that all permissible operations within the theory can be traced rigorously back to these axioms , rules , and primitive notions . This characterizes Euclid's formulation of geometry , but not Ptolemy's astronomy . There are in The Almagest no rules for determining in advance whether a new epicycle will be required for dealing with abberations in lunar , solar , or planetary behavior . The strongest appeal of the Copernican formulation consisted in just this : ideally , the justification for dealing with special problems in particular ways is completely set out in the basic ' rules ' of the theory . The lower-level hypotheses are never ' ad hoc ' , never introduced ex post facto just to sweep up within the theory some recalcitrant datum . Copernicus , to an extent unachieved by Ptolemy , approximated to Euclid's vision . De Revolutionibus is not just a collection of facts and techniques . It is an organized system of these things . Solving astronomical problems requires , for Copernicus , not a random search of unrelated tables , but a regular employment of the rules defining the entire discipline . Hence , noting the simplicity achieved in Copernicus' formulation does not provide another reason for the acceptance of De Revolutionibus , another reason beyond its systematic superiority . It provides exactly the same reason . 1543 A.D. is often venerated as the birthday of the scientific revolution . It is really the funeral day of scholastic science . Granted , the cosmological , philosophical , and cultural reverberations initiated by the De Revolutionibus were felt with increasing violence during the 300 years to follow . But , considered within technical astronomy , a different pattern can be traced . In what does the dissatisfaction of Copernicus-the-astronomer consist ? What in The Almagest draws his fire ? Geocentricism per se ? No . The formal displacement of the geocentric principle far from being Copernicus' primary concern , was introduced only to resolve what seemed to him intolerable in orthodox astronomy , namely , the ' unphysical ' triplication of centric reference-points : one center from which the planet's distances were calculated , another around which planetary velocities were computed , and still a third center ( the earth ) from which the observations originated . This arrangement was for Copernicus literally monstrous : `` With ( the Ptolemaists ) it is as though an artist were to gather the hands , feet , head and other members for his images from divers models , each part excellently drawn , but not related to a single body ; ; and since they in no way match each other , the result would be a monster rather than a man '' . Copernicus required a systematically integrated , physically intelligible astronomy . His objective was , essentially , to repair those aspects of orthodox astronomy responsible for its deficiencies in achieving these ends . That such deficiencies existed within Ptolemy's theory was not discovered de novo by Copernicus . The critical , rigorous examinations of Nicholas of Cusa and Nicholas of Oresme provided the context ( a late medieval context ) for Nicholas Copernicus' own work . The latter looked backward upon inherited deficiencies . Without abandoning too much , Copernicus sought to make orthodox astronomy systematically and mechanically acceptable . He did not think himself to be firing the first shot of an intellectual revolution . Henrietta's feeling of identity with Sara Sullam was crowned by her discovery of the coincidence that Sara's epitaph in the Jewish cemetery in Venice referred to her as `` the Sulamite '' . Into the texture of this tapestry of history and human drama Henrietta , as every artist delights to do , wove strands of her own intuitive insights into human nature and -- especially in the remarkable story of the attraction and conflict between two so disparate and fervent characters as this pair -- into the relations of men and women : `` In their relations , she was the giver and he the receiver , nay the demander . His feeling always exacted sacrifices from her . One is so accustomed to think of men as the privileged who need but ask and receive , and women as submissive and yielding , that our sympathies are usually enlisted on the side of the man whose love is not returned , and we condemn the woman as a coquette . The very firmness of her convictions and logical clearness of her arguments captivated and stimulated him to make greater efforts ; ; usually , this is most exasperating to men , who expect every woman to verify their preconceived notions concerning her sex , and when she does not , immediately condemn her as eccentric and unwomanly . She had the opportunity that few clever women can resist , of showing her superiority in argument over a man . Women themselves have come to look upon matters in the same light as the outside world , and scarcely find any wrong in submitting to the importunities of a stronger will , even when their affections are withheld . She was exposing herself to temptation which it is best to avoid where it can consistently be done . One who invites such trials of character is either foolhardy , overconfident or too simple and childlike in faith in mankind to see the danger . In any case but the last , such a course is sure to avenge itself upon the individual ; ; the moral powers no more than the physical and mental , can bear overstraining . And , in the last case , a bitter disappointment but too often meets the confiding nature . '' Henrietta was discovering in the process of writing , as the born writer does , not merely a channel for the discharge of accumulated information but a stimulus to the development of the creative powers of observation , insight and intuition . Dr. Isaacs was so pleased with the quality of her biographical study of Sara Sullam that he considered submitting it to the Century Magazine or Harper's but he decided that its Jewish subject probably would not interest them and published it in The Messenger , `` so our readers will be benefited instead '' . Under her father's influence it did not occur to Henrietta that she might write on subjects outside the Jewish field , but she did begin writing for other Anglo-Jewish papers and thus increased her output and her audience . And she wrote the libretto for an oratorio on the subject of Judas Maccabeus performed at the Hanukkah festival which came in December . By her eighteenth birthday her bent for writing was so evident that Papa and Mamma gave her a Life Of Dickens as a spur to her aspiration . Another source of intellectual stimulus was opened to her at that time by the founding of Johns Hopkins University within walking distance of home . It was established in a couple of buildings in the shopping district , with only a few professors , but all eminent men , and a few hundred eager students housed in nearby dwellings . In September '76 Thomas Huxley , Darwin's famous disciple , came from England to speak in a crowded auditorium at the formal opening of the University ; ; and although it was a school for men only , it afforded Henrietta an opportunity to attend its public lectures . In the following year her father undertook to give a course in Hebrew theology to Johns Hopkins students , and this brought to the Szold house a group of bright young Jews who had come to Baltimore to study , and who enjoyed being fed and mothered by Mamma and entertained by Henrietta and Rachel , who played and sang for them in the upstairs sitting room on Sunday evenings . From Philadelphia came Cyrus Adler and Joseph Jastrow . Adler , Judge Sulzberger's nephew , came to study Assyriology . A smart , shrewd and ambitious young man , well connected , and with a knack for getting in the good graces of important people , he was bound to go far . Joseph Jastrow , the younger son of the distinguished rabbi , Marcus Jastrow , was a friendly , round-faced fellow with a little mustache , whose field was psychology , and who was also a punster and a jolly tease . His father was a good friend of Rabbi Szold , and Joe lived with the Szolds for a while . Both these youths , who greatly admired Henrietta , were somewhat younger than she , as were also the neighboring Friedenwald boys , who were then studying medicine ; ; and bright though they all were , they could not possibly compete for her interest with Papa , whose mind -- although he never tried to dazzle or patronize lesser lights with it -- naturally eclipsed theirs and made them seem to her even younger than they were . Besides , Miss Henrietta -- as she was generally known since she had put up her hair with a chignon in the back -- had little time to spare them from her teaching and writing ; ; so Cyrus Adler became interested in her friend Racie Friedenwald , and Joe Jastrow -- the only young man who when he wrote had the temerity to address her as Henrietta , and signed himself Joe -- fell in love with pretty sister Rachel . Henrietta , however , was at that time engaged in a lengthy correspondence with Joe's older and more serious brother , Morris , who was just about her own age and whom she had got to know well during trips to Philadelphia with Papa , when he substituted for Rabbi Jastrow at Rodeph Shalom Temple there during its Rabbi's absence in Europe . Young Morris , who , while attending the University of Pennsylvania , also taught and edited a paper , found time to write Henrietta twenty-page letters on everything that engaged his interest , from the acting of Sarah Bernhardt in Philadelphia to his reactions to the comments of `` Sulamith '' on the Jewish reform movement being promulgated by the Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati . Unlike his younger brother , Joe , he never presumed to address her more familiarly than as `` My dear friend '' , although he praised and envied the elegance and purity of her style . And when he complained of the lack of time for all he wanted to do , Henrietta advised him to rise at five in the morning as she and Papa did . One thing Papa had not taught Henrietta was how to handle a young man as high-spirited and opinionated as herself . She could not resist the opportunity `` of showing her superiority in argument over a man '' which she had remarked as one of the `` feminine follies '' of Sara Sullam ; ; and in her forthright way , Henrietta , who in her story of Sara had indicated her own unwillingness `` to think of men as the privileged '' and `` women as submissive and yielding '' , felt obliged to defend vigorously any statement of hers to which Morris Jastrow took the slightest exception -- he objected to her stand on the Corbin affair , as well as on the radical reforms of Dr. Wise of Hebrew Union College -- until once , in sheer desperation , he wrote that he had given up hope they would ever agree on anything . But that did not prevent him from writing more long letters , or from coming to spend his Christmas vacations with the hospitable , lively Szolds in their pleasant house on Lombard Street . 1880s : `` little women '' `` we've got Father and Mother and each other '' said Beth on the first page of Louisa Alcott's Little Women ; ; and , `` I do think that families are the most beautiful things in all the world '' , burst out Jo some five hundred pages later in that popular story of the March family , which had first appeared when Henrietta was eight ; ; and the Szold family , as it developed , bore a striking resemblance to the Marches . Mr. March , like Benjamin Szold , was a clergyman , although of an indeterminate denomination ; ; and `` Marmee '' March , like Sophie Szold , was the competent manager of her brood of girls , of whom the Marches had only four to the Szolds' five . But the March girls had their counterparts in the Szold girls . Henrietta could easily identify herself with Jo March , although Jo was not the eldest sister . Neither was Henrietta hoydenish like Jo , who frankly wished she were a boy and had deliberately shortened her name , which , like Henrietta's , was the feminine form of a boy's name . But both were high-spirited and vivacious , both had tempers to control , both loved languages , especially English and German , both were good teachers and wrote for publication . Each was her mother's assistant and confidante ; ; and each stood out conspicuously in the family picture . Bertha Szold was more like Meg , the eldest March girl , who `` learned that a woman's happiest kingdom is home , her highest honor the art of ruling it , not as a queen , but a wise wife and mother '' . Bertha , blue-eyed like Mamma , was from the start her mother's daughter , destined for her mother's role in life . Sadie , like Beth March , suffered ill health -- got rheumatic fever and had to be careful of her heart -- but that never dampened her spirits . When her right hand was incapacitated by the rheumatism , Sadie learned to write with her left hand . She wrote gay plays about the girls for family entertainments , like `` Oh , What Fun ! A Comedy In Three Acts '' , in which , under `` Personages '' , Henrietta appeared as `` A Schoolmarm '' , and Bertha , who was only a trifle less brilliant in high school than Henrietta had been , appeared as `` Dummkopf '' . Sadie studied piano ; ; played Chopin in the `` Soiree Musicale of Mr. Guthrie's Pupils '' ; ; and she recited `` Hector's Farewell To Andromache '' most movingly , to the special delight of Rabbi Jastrow at his home in Germantown near Philadelphia , where the Szold girls took turns visiting between the visits of the Jastrow boys at the Szolds' in Baltimore . Adele , like Amy , the youngest of the Marches , was the rebellious , mischievous , rather calculating and ambitious one . For Rachel , conceded to be the prettiest of the Szold girls -- and she did make a pretty picture sitting in the grape-arbor strumming her guitar and singing in her silvery tones -- there was no particular March counterpart ; ; but both groups were so closely knit that despite individual differences the family life in both cases was remarkably similar in atmosphere if not entirely in content -- the one being definitely Jewish and the other vaguely Christian . The Szolds , like the Marches , enjoyed and loved living together , even in troubled times ; ; and , as in the March home , any young man who called on the Szolds found himself confronted with a phalanx of femininity which made it rather difficult to direct his particular attention to any one of them . This included Mamma , jolly , generous , and pretty , with whom they all fell in love , just as Papa had first fallen in love with her Mamma before he chose her ; ; and when a young man like Morris Jastrow had enjoyed the Szold hospitality , he felt obliged to send his respects and his gifts not merely to Henrietta , in whom he was really interested , but to all the Szold girls and Mamma . And just as `` Laurie '' Lawrence was first attracted to bright Jo March , who found him immature by her high standards , and then had to content himself with her younger sister Amy , so Joe Jastrow , who had also been writing Henrietta before he came to Johns Hopkins , had to content himself with her younger sister , pretty Rachel . And like Jo March , who saw her sisters Meg and Amy involved in `` lovering '' before herself , Henrietta saw her sisters Rachel and Sadie drawn outside their family circle by the attraction of suitors , Rachel by Joe Jastrow , and Sadie by Max Lobl , a young businessman who would write her romantic descriptions of his trips by steamboat down the Mississippi . This time he was making no mistake . Olgivanna -- in her country the nickname was a respectful form of address -- was not only attractive but shrewd , durable , sensible , and smart . No wonder Wright was enchanted -- no two better suited people ever met . Almost from that day , until his death , Olgivanna was to stay at his side ; ; but the years that immediately followed were to be extraordinarily trying , both for Wright and his Montenegrin lady . It must be granted that the flouting of convention , no matter how well intentioned one may be , is sure to lead to trouble , or at least to the discomfort that goes with social disapproval . Even so , many of the things that happened to Wright and Olgivanna seem inordinately severe . Their afflictions centered on one maddening difficulty : Miriam held up the divorce proceedings that she herself had asked for . Reporters began to trail Miriam everywhere , and to encourage her to make appalling statements about Wright and his doings . Flocks of writs , attachments , and unpleasant legal papers of every sort began to fly through the air . The distracted Miriam would agree to a settlement through her legal representative , then change her mind and make another attack on Wright as a person . At last her lawyer , Arthur D. Cloud , gave up the case because she turned down three successive settlements he arranged . Cloud made an interesting statement in parting from his client : `` I wanted to be a lawyer , and Mrs. Wright wanted me to be an avenging angel . So I got out . Mrs. Wright is without funds . The first thing to do is get her some money by a temporary but definite adjustment pending a final disposition of the case . But every time I suggested this to her , Mrs. Wright turned it down and demanded that I go out and punish Mr. Wright . I am an attorney , not an instrument of vengeance '' . Miriam Noel disregarded the free advice of her departing counselor , and appointed a heavy-faced young man named Harold Jackson to take his place . There were three years of this strange warfare ; ; and during the unhappy time , Miriam often would charge that Wright and Olgivanna were misdemeanants against the public order of Wisconsin . Yet somehow , when officers were prodded into visiting Taliesin to execute the warrants , they would find neither Wright nor Olgivanna at home . This showed that common sense had not died out at the county and village level -- though why the unhappy and obviously unbalanced woman was not restrained remains a puzzle . The misery of Miriam's bitterness can be felt today by anyone who studies the case -- it was hopeless , agonizing , and destructive , with Miriam herself bearing the heaviest burden of shame and pain . To get an idea of the embarrassment and chagrin that was heaped upon Wright and Olgivanna , we should bear in mind that the raids were sometimes led by Miriam in person . One of the most distressing of these scenes occurred at Spring Green toward the end of the open warfare , on a beautiful day in June . At this time Miriam Noel appeared , urging on Constable Henry Pengally , whose name showed him to be a descendant of the Welsh settlers in the neighborhood . A troop of reporters brought up the rear . Miriam was stopped at the Taliesin gate , and William Weston , now the estate foreman , came out to parley . He said that Mr. Wright was not in , and so could not be arrested on something called a peace warrant that Miriam was waving in the air . Miriam now ordered Pengally to break down the gate , but he said he really couldn't go that far . At this point Mrs. Frances Cupply , one of Wright's handsome daughters by his first wife , came from the house and tried to calm Miriam as she tore down a no visitors sign and smashed the glass pane on another sign with a rock . Miriam Noel Wright said , `` Here I am at my own home , locked out so I must stand in the road '' ! Then she rounded on Weston and cried , `` You always did Wright's dirty work ! When I take over Taliesin , the first thing I'll do is fire you '' . `` Madame Noel , I think you had better go '' , said Mrs. Cupply . `` And I think you had better leave '' , replied Miriam . Turning to the reporters , she asked , `` Did you hear her ? ' I think you had better leave ' ! And this is my own home '' . In the silence that followed , Miriam walked close to Mrs. Cupply , who drew back a step on her side of the gate . Then , with staring eyes and lips drawn thin , Miriam said to the young woman , `` You are ugly -- uglier than you used to be , and you were always very ugly . You are even uglier than Mr. Wright '' . The animosity expressed by such a scene had the penetrating quality of a natural force ; ; and it gave Miriam Noel a fund of energy like that of a person inspired to complete some great and universal work of art . As if to make certain that Wright would be unable to pay any settlement at all , Miriam wrote to prospective clients denouncing him ; ; she also went to Washington and appealed to Senator George William Norris of Nebraska , the Fighting Liberal , from whose office a sympathetic but cautious harrumphing was heard . Then , after overtures to accept a settlement and go through with a divorce , Miriam gave a ghastly echo of Mrs. Micawber by suddenly stating , `` I will never leave Mr. Wright '' . Under this kind of pressure , it is not surprising that Wright would make sweeping statements to the newspapers . Miriam had not yet goaded him into mentioning her directly , but one can feel the generalized anger in Wright's remarks to reporters when he was asked , one morning on arrival in Chicago , what he thought of the city as a whole . First , Wright said , he was choked by the smoke , which fortunately kept him from seeing the dreadful town . But surely Michigan Avenue was handsome ? `` That isn't a boulevard , it's a racetrack '' ! Cried Wright , showing that automobiles were considered to be a danger as early as the 1920's . `` This is a horrible way to live '' , Wright went on . `` You are being strangled by traffic '' . He was then asked for a solution of the difficulty , and began to talk trenchant sense , though private anguish showed through in the vehemence of his manner . `` Take a gigantic knife and sweep it over the Loop '' , Wright said . `` Cut off every building at the seventh floor . Spread everything out . You don't need concentration . If you cut down these horrible buildings you'll have no more traffic jams . You'll have trees again . You'll have some joy in the life of this city . After all , that's the job of the architect -- to give the world a little joy '' . Little enough joy was afforded Wright in the spring of 1925 , when another destructive fire broke out at Taliesin . The first news stories had it that this blaze was started by a bolt of lightning , as though Miriam could call down fire from heaven like a prophet of the Old Testament . A storm did take place that night , and fortunately enough , it included a cloudburst that helped put out the flames . Later accounts blamed defective wiring for starting the fire ; ; at any rate , heat grew so intense in the main part of the house that it melted the window panes , and fused the K'ang-si pottery to cinders . Wright set his loss at $200,000 , a figure perhaps justified by the unique character of the house that had been ruined , and the faultless taste that had gone into the selection of the prints and other things that were destroyed . In spite of the disaster , Wright completed during this period plans for the Lake Tahoe resort , in which he suggested the shapes of American Indian tepees -- a project of great and appropriate charm , that came to nothing . Amid a shortage of profitable work , the memory of Albert Johnson's $20,000 stood out in lonely grandeur -- the money had quickly melted away . A series of conferences with friends and bankers began about this time ; ; and the question before these meetings was , here is a man of international reputation and proved earning power ; ; how can he be financed so that he can find the work he ought to do ? While this was under consideration , dauntless as ever Wright set about the building of Taliesin 3 . As he made plans for the new Taliesin , Wright also got on paper his conception of a cathedral of steel and glass to house a congregation of all faiths , and the idea for a planetarium with a sloping ramp . Years were to pass before these plans came off the paper , and Wright was justified in thinking , as the projects failed , that much of what he had to show his country and the world would never be seen except by visitors to Taliesin . And now there was some question as to his continued residence there . Billy Koch , who had once worked for Wright as a chauffeur , gave a deposition for Miriam's use that he had seen Olgivanna living at Taliesin . This might put Wright in such a bad light before a court that Miriam would be awarded Taliesin ; ; nor was she moved by a letter from Wright pointing out that if he was not `` compelled to spend money on useless lawyer's bills , useless hotel bills , and useless doctor's bills '' , he could more quickly provide Miriam with a suitable home either in Los Angeles or Paris , as she preferred . Miriam sniffed at this , and complained that Wright had said unkind things about her to reporters . His reply was , `` Everything that has been printed derogatory to you , purporting to have come from me , was a betrayal , and nothing yet has been printed which I have sanctioned '' . What irritated Miriam was that Wright had told the papers about a reasonable offer he had made , which he considered she would accept `` when she tires of publicity '' . From her California headquarters , Miriam fired back , `` I shall never divorce Mr. Wright , to permit him to marry Olga Milanoff '' . Then Miriam varied the senseless psychological warfare by suddenly withdrawing a suit for separate maintenance that had been pending , and asking for divorce on the grounds of cruelty , with the understanding that Wright would not contest it . The Bank of Wisconsin sent a representative to the judge's chambers in Madison to give information on Wright's ability to meet the terms . He said that the architect might reasonably be expected to carry his financial burdens if all harrassment could be brought to an end , and that the bank would accept a mortgage on Taliesin to help bring this about . Miriam said that she must be assured that `` that other woman , Olga , will not be in luxury while I am scraping along '' . This exhausted Wright's patience , and in consequence he talked freely to reporters in a Madison hotel suite . `` Volstead laws , speed laws , divorce laws '' , he said , `` as they now stand , demoralize the individual , make liars and law breakers of us in one way or another , and tend to make our experiment in democracy absurd . If Mrs. Wright doesn't accept the terms in the morning , I'll go either to Tokyo or to Holland , to do what I can . I realize , in taking this stand , just what it means to me and mine '' . Here Wright gave a slight sigh of weariness , and continued , `` It means more long years lived across the social grain of the life of our people , making shift to live in the face of popular disrespect and misunderstanding as I best can for myself and those dependent upon me '' . Next day , word came that Miriam was not going through with the divorce ; ; but Wright stayed in the United States . His mentioning of Japan and Holland had been merely the expression of wishful thinking . No matter what troubles might betide him , this most American of artists knew in his heart he could not function properly outside his native land .
